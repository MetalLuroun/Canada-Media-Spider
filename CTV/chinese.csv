	A subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma, according to a person familiar with a Justice Department tax investigation of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden's son.
	The breadth of the subpoena, issued Tuesday, underscores the wide-angle lens prosecutors are taking as they examine the younger Biden's finances and international business ventures.
	Hunter Biden's ties to Burisma in particular have long dogged the policy work and political aspirations of his father, Joe Biden, now the president-elect of the United States. It's unclear whether Hunter Biden's work at the Ukrainian company is a central part of the federal investigation or whether prosecutors are simply seeking information about all his sources of income in recent years.
	The person was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	A lawyer for the younger Biden, George Mesires, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment for this story and a spokesman for the Biden transition team declined to comment.
	Hunter Biden confirmed Wednesday that his taxes are under federal investigation. The revelation comes at a delicate time for the president-elect, who is building out his Cabinet and will soon decide on his nominee to run the Justice Department, the same department overseeing the investigation into his son.
	In addition to the Burisma-related request, the subpoena issued last week also seeks information on Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other financial transactions.
	The probe was launched in 2018, the year before his father announced his candidacy for president. At one point in the investigation, federal prosecutors were also examining potential money laundering offences, two people familiar with the matter told the AP.
	Hunter Biden said he only learned of the investigation on Tuesday.
	The younger Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then vice-president, was helping conduct the Obama administration's foreign policy with Ukraine. President Donald Trump and his allies have long argued, without evidence, that Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine influenced the Obama administration's policies toward the Eastern European nation.
	Senate Republicans said in a report earlier this year that the appointment may have posed a conflict of interest but did not provide evidence that any policies were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	The president-elect is not believed to be a focus of the investigation. He has not weighed in on the merits of the investigation, saying only to reporters on Friday that he was ""proud of my son.""
	For months, the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh has also been collecting information from Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and others as part of the Justice Department's process to receive and analyze information related to Ukraine, including documents Giuliani wanted to present to prosecutors that he had been gathering in Ukraine about Joe and Hunter Biden.
	In announcing that process in February, Barr cautioned that the department had to be careful about any information coming from Ukraine, saying: ""There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, a lot of cross currents. And we can't take anything we received from Ukraine at face value.""
	The former New York City mayor was a main character when the House voted to impeach Trump. The impeachment inquiry centred on Trump's dealings with Ukraine's president and whether he abused his office by seeking the investigation into the Bidens. Giuliani pressured officials to do the investigations and has been pushing unsubstantiated corruption allegations against the Bidens.
	Giuliani himself had also been under federal investigation, with federal prosecutors in Manhattan examining whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the matter. It was unclear whether that investigation remains active as Trump has discussed the possibility of preemptive pardons for some of his family members and close associates, including Giuliani."

              Hong Kong's Jimmy Lai denied bail as Pompeo tweets support

              Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.

	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.
	Pence also tweeted about Lai, saying the charges against him are ""an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere."""

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

              As leaders set fresh climate goals, Biden pledges U.S. support

              U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world. 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was “alarmed” that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the People’s Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canada’s arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	“Our government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,” said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	“It was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence … because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,” Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in “hostage diplomacy” and that the Chinese government back then “is completely different to the Chinese government today.”
	Conservative leader Erin O’Toole called the joint training exercise a “dangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.”
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	China’s President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending China’s interests.
	Meng’s arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department’s efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	“We will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,” Sajjan said.

              Diverse TV holiday season includes all-Asian Lifetime movie
          
","
              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”

                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/diverse-tv-holiday-season-includes-all-asian-lifetime-movie-1.5227204,"
	In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”
	Retorts Suzy: “I'm from Maine.”
	A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like “Chinese virus” and “kung flu.”
	“I think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,” Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. “I really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.”
	“A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.
	Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.
	“It was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,” Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and “full of Christmas heart.”
	Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).
	Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in “The Farewell” and “Mulan,” Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.
	“It was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,” Ma said in an email. “Lifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.”
	In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.
	“I think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,” Giroux says.
	Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.
	“I'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,” Giroux says. “That's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.”
	Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching “Crazy Rich Asians,” the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.
	“You hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,” Lai says. ”I am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.“
	The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.
	“I love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,” says Jennifer Liao, the director. “It's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.”
	“Sugar & Spice” is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's “Christmas Ever After.”
	Does Liao feel pressure as “the first” even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? “I feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,” Liao says.
	Lai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.
	“I think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,” Lai says. “We get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.”

	India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.

Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistant

	U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.
	Bloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.
	It quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau ""according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.""
	China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.
	Bloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.
	It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.
	""We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,"" a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
	Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.
	China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.
	China this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.
	Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials."

	China's sales of SUVs, minivans and sedans rose by double digits in November as the country recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, but were below pre-virus levels for the year, an industry group reported Friday.
	Sales in the industry's biggest global market rose 11.6% over a year earlier to 2.3 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 12.6% to 2.8 million, holding steady at October's growth rate.
	From January to November, passenger vehicle sales were off 7.6% from the same period of 2019, at 17.8 million. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 20.6% to 4.7 million.
	Full-year auto sales are on track to decline for a third year after hitting a peak in 2017.
	China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first country to reopen its economy after the disease was declared under control in March.
	November sales of all-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled, rising 104.9% over a year earlier. Sales in the first 11 months of 2020 edged back above pre-virus levels, rising 3.9% over a year earlier.
	Auto demand already was weak before China closed factories and dealerships in February to fight the coronavirus. Consumers are uneasy about slowing economic growth and a tariff war with Washington.
	That hurts global automakers that are looking to China to propel sales growth and are spending heavily to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet Chinese government sales quotas."

Chinese man extradited from Malaysia to U.S. over turtle-smuggling ring worth millions

A Chinese citizen who allegedly financed a turtle-trafficking ring has been extradited from Malaysia to the United States, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in a statement on Thursday.
	Kang Juntao, 24, from Hangzhou in eastern China, was initially charged with money laundering last February. Between June 2017 and December 2018, he allegedly financed a nationwide ring of people who purchased turtles in the U.S. belonging to five protected species, and arranged for them to be illegally shipped to Hong Kong.
	""The turtles were inhumanely bound with duct tape and placed in socks so as not to alert customs authorities,"" the DOJ statement said.
	According to Kang's indictment, at least 1,500 turtles -- with a total value of US$2,250,000 -- were smuggled out of the U.S.
	Using a PayPal account, Kang allegedly purchased turtles from sellers advertising on social media or reptile trade websites.
	These sellers allegedly shipped the turtles to ""middlemen"" who were ""typically Chinese citizens who entered the country on student visas,"" according to the DOJ. Kang allegedly paid and instructed them to repackage the turtles, and use false labels for shipment to Hong Kong.
	Once in Hong Kong, the turtles were allegedly sold on the black market for thousands of dollars each.
	Kang allegedly did not declare the turtles to U.S. or Chinese customs, or obtain required permits from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
	Authorities allege Kang trafficked the eastern box turtle, the Florida box turtle, the Gulf Coast box turtle, the spotted turtle, and the wood turtle -- all protected species under the CITES treaty.
	Kang was arrested at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport last January before his extradition to the U.S. on Thursday.
	""Wildlife trafficking is a serious crime that impacts imperiled species at home and abroad,"" said Aurelia Skipwith, director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, in the DOJ statement."

              Bahrain plans free shots, Saudi Arabia approves Pfizer vaccine

	Bahrain has announced plans to give the public free coronavirus vaccines, as Saudi Arabia said it approved an inoculation by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to fight the pandemic.
	The island nation of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, made the vaccine pledge in an announcement published late Thursday by its state-run Bahrain News Agency.
	""A safe vaccine will be provided free of charge to all citizens and residents within the kingdom,"" the statement said, without elaborating on which vaccine it would offer.
	Bahrain plans to inoculate everyone 18 years and older in the kingdom at 27 different medical facilities, hoping to be able to vaccinate 10,000 people a day. Bahrain, an island in the Persian Gulf home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, has a population of around 1.5 million people.
	A week ago, Bahrain said it had become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine after the United Kingdom.
	The Pfizer shots, a so-called ""mRNA vaccine,"" contain a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. To be vaccinated, a person receives two shots over 21 days.
	In the time since, Bahrain has not responded to questions from The Associated Press, including on Friday. Pfizer told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the ""timing of delivery and the volume of doses,"" were confidential and declined to comment.
	Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculated some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine is an ""inactivated"" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it.
	The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday described the Sinopharm vaccine as 86 per cent effective, but provided few details and answered no questions. It marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of that shot.
	Earlier Thursday, Saudi Arabia's Food and Drug Authority said it had registered the Pfizer vaccine ""so that health authorities in the kingdom can then import and use the vaccine.""
	The kingdom said it based its decision on information given by Pfizer on Nov. 24, without elaborating. Pfizer on Nov. 18 said its vaccine is 95 per cent effective.
	A major challenge for the Pfizer shot in the Mideast remains the weather, however. The vaccines must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
	Saudi Arabia said its Health Ministry later would announce plans on how it would distribute the vaccine in the kingdom, the biggest Gulf Arab state, with a population of 34 million people.
	Egypt received its first shipment of the Sinopharm vaccine on Thursday via the United Arab Emirates."

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's historically challenging transition to power is suddenly becoming even more complicated.
	A federal investigation into the finances of Biden's son Hunter threatens to embolden congressional Republicans, who have already shown little willingness to work with the incoming president or even acknowledge his clear victory in last month's election. For sure, it will complicate Senate confirmation hearings for Biden's yet-to-be-named attorney general, who could ultimately have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son.
	It all raises the prospect of even deeper dysfunction in a capital that is already struggling to address the nation's most pressing crises, including a surging pandemic whose daily death tolls are beginning to surpass the devastation of the Sept. 11 attacks. Republicans, particularly those eyeing presidential runs in 2024, are making clear they will press Biden on the issue.
	""Joe Biden needs to pledge today that he will co-operate with the federal investigation and answer any questions under oath,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Thursday, ""and that if he is sworn in as president, no federal investigator or attorney working on the Hunter Biden criminal case will be removed.""
	Hunter Biden has long been a source of worry for his father's campaign and was the subject of repeated unsupported accusations by President Donald Trump and his allies. But news of the probe, which was revealed on Wednesday and scrutinizes some of Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other transactions, caught most of his father's staffers by surprise.
	The president-elect had no public appearance Thursday as he moved forward with filling out his administration. But the investigation threatens to destabilize a transition that has prioritized a methodical rollout of Cabinet selections, White House hires and policy goals -- all meant to guarantee momentum when Biden takes office and immediately has to grapple with a surging pandemic and shaky economy.
	Most notably, the probe casts a spotlight on one of Biden's most important choices: his attorney general.
	Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland have emerged as the leading contenders, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press this week. But dynamics could shift, as any Biden choice now will be scrutinized for any perceived loyalty to the president-elect and bias in any probe of his son.
	Both Garland and especially Jones have longtime ties to Biden.
	The president-elect himself is not a subject of the investigation. And Biden aides believe that because other Hunter Biden stories have blown over, this will, too. They note that a tax fraud investigation pales in comparison to Trump's refusal to concede the election or to the pandemic that has killed more than 290,000 Americans.
	Biden is expected to announce more Cabinet picks, but not attorney general, on Friday.
	Trump's initial public response was surprisingly muted, just a pair of tweets about a Fox News segment on the story Wednesday night. But privately, he demanded to know why the investigation was not revealed ahead of Election Day, accusing officials of deliberately stalling in order to help Biden's chances, according to two Republicans familiar with the conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.
	Other Republicans, including possible presidential contenders, were anything but shy in piling on.
	""If there were ever circumstances that created a conflict of interest and called for a special counsel, I think those circumstances are present here,"" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Thursday. ""The Biden family has been trading on Joe Biden's public office for 50 years. Do we really think that that will change if Joe Biden becomes president, the highest office in the land?""
	Some of Trump's children have also faced some legal questions.
	Donald Trump Jr. was scrutinized in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe for the 2016 meeting he had with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. And Ivanka Trump was recently deposed by investigators from the District of Columbia attorney general's office as part of its lawsuit alleging the misuse of inaugural funds.
	The Hunter Biden investigation is the latest in a series of politically charged inquiries that the Justice Department has grappled with in the past five years, following probes into Hillary Clinton's email use and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
	Regardless of the facts of the investigation, a new Justice Department will likely feel compelled to assert its independence from the White House following allegations that its actions were overly politicized during the Trump administration. Biden has said he will play no role in department investigative decisions.
	""There are plenty of people that are going to have their hands in this one, but I think it's really going to be driven by the new administration's push to have total independence on any investigation,"" said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Weinstein, a New Jersey defence lawyer.
	""I think that's going to be paramount,"" he added. ""They are going to bend over backwards to make sure that they do the contrary to the current administration -- which is independence, let the investigation takes its course.""
	In this case, though, there is no perfect outcome for Biden.
	A protracted criminal investigation that results in an indictment would be a major distraction and then some as the new president tries to implement his agenda. But if the Justice Department decides against bringing charges, officials will feel pressure to explain their steps and reassure the American public the inquiry was done in a competent and thorough way.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including to Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe.
	The federal investigation, centring on potential tax crimes, had been going on at least a year before Biden announced his candidacy. Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to voting because of a department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts.
	Biden, fiercely protective of his own family, was said to be, in a statement released by his transition, ""deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	Biden struck a similarly defiant tone throughout the campaign whenever questions emerged about his son, which they frequently did. When Trump assailed Hunter Biden as a drug user during the first presidential debate in Cleveland, his father acknowledged that Hunter had had past substance abuse issues but added, ""He's worked on it. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.""
	The spotlight on Hunter Biden intensified in the election's final weeks, after Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed unsubstantiated claims about his foreign business dealings. Those were based in part on New York Post reporting on a laptop that supposedly once belonged to Hunter Biden and was abandoned at a Delaware repair shop.
	Hunter Biden had joined the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then the vice-president, was helping conduct Obama administration foreign policy with Ukraine. But, in a subsequent report, Senate Republicans did not produce any evidence that the hiring influenced U.S. policies.
	Joe Biden largely refused to even acknowledge the laptop controversy. His son, meanwhile, kept almost completely out of the public eye during the nearly 18 months his father was running for president.
	One of the few times he was seen was on stage outside the convention centre in Wilmington, Delaware, as his father was surrounded by joyous family members following his speech declaring victory in the presidential election. Hunter Biden, and his baby son, were right in the middle.

              'None of us imagined this': Michael Kovrig's wife marks two-year anniversary of his detention

	On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrig’s imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.
	""Here we are, two years later, still speaking about him being in detention. None of us would have imagined this was going to be the case,"" said Vina Nadjibulla in an interview on CTV’s Power Play on Thursday.
	""I hoped sincerely that Michael would be home by now and instead he’s facing a prospect of his third Christmas alone, in isolation, in detention.""
	Kovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested in China on Dec. 10, 2018, and charged with allegations of state spying for Canada. The Canadian government calls their detention arbitrary, while most in the diplomatic community view it as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days prior in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request.
	Consular access has been limited throughout the pandemic; the two men went 10 months without communication with Canadian representatives.
	""Our contact has been very limited between January and October. There were no consular visits, there were very few letters from Michael. Finally, in October we were able to get a consular visit and at least confirmation and a reassurance that he is still healthy and is doing well,"" said Nadjibulla, who is married to Kovrig but separated.
	Canada’s Ambassador to China Dominic Barton who is leading the effort to secure Kovrig and Spavor’s release, told a House of Commons committee this week that the two men looked ""robust"" and that one ""would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Nadjibulla called that long-awaited visit this fall a ""huge relief"" but notes she remains deeply concerned about his mental health.
	""Michael is doing everything he possibly can to keep his mind occupied with positive thoughts, with virtuous thoughts, with prayers of gratitude, with philosophical passages. Reading really provides him solace day-to-day, he essentially says that is what gets him through moment-to-moment, is being able to read and have access to books, which we’ve been advocating for quite a bit,"" said Nadjibulla.
	The Liberal government remains adamant it’s doing all it can to free the men, despite opposition criticism that Ottawa has been ""kowtowing"" to China over the last several years.
	""Today is the sad anniversary of the illegal abduction and imprisonment of two innocent Canadians in China,"" said Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole during a press conference on Thursday.
	""For months China has unfairly targeted our farming exports. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out mass internment of the Uighurs in concentration camps and still the Liberals keep pushing for more involvement and more engagement with China.""
	Optimism sparked last week when the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Justice Department was in talks with Meng’s legal team to resolve her fraud charges and allow her to return home should she admit to criminal wrongdoing. It led to speculation that the arrangement could pave a way for Kovrig and Spavor’s freedom.
	Nadjibulla says, more broadly, she was left hopeful after hearing that during the first call between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden the leaders discussed the fate of the two men.
	""I pray that we will be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.

	Politicians from various Western countries have asked consumers to buy Australian wine in order to fight back against China's punitive tariffs on the beverage.
	China is the most important export market for Australian wine, and winemakers are scrambling to find new markets following Beijing's decision to slap tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine imports amid an escalating trade war between the two nations.
	Now a number of public figures associated with the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which calls itself ""an international cross-party group of legislators working to reform the approach of democratic countries to China,"" have called on consumers to stand up to Beijing.
	""We are asking you all to join us in standing against Xi Jinping's authoritarian bullying,"" said Miriam Lexmann, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) representing the Christian Democrats, in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday.
	""By drinking a bottle or two of Australian wine and letting the Chinese Communist Party know that we will not be bullied,"" added Elisabet Lann, a municipal councilor from Sweden's Christian Democrats.
	Other politicians featured in the video include Australian MP Kimberley Kitching, US Senator Ted Yoho and Shiori Yamao, an independent member of Japan's House of Representatives.
	Tony Battaglene, CEO of Australian Grape and Wine, a national association, said Beijing's tariffs have endangered business with mainland China.
	Battaglene works with around 800 wine producers in Australia who have ""built their businesses"" around exporting to China and are now left with no backup plan, he added.
	""We were surprised, we were shocked,"" Battaglene told CNN Business. ""Having the extent of these interim tariffs, I mean essentially they will close the market to Australian bottled wine, to premium wine, in China. There's no way that we can compete at those levels.""
	China's Commerce Ministry announced Friday that its decision was made after finding preliminary evidence of dumping. Australian officials have bitterly protested the move, saying that China has been unable to provide proof.
	The wine war is taking place against the backdrop of a wider deterioration in relations. Australia has upset China this year by calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing later targeted Canberra over trade, namely by suspending some imports of beef and slapping heavy tariffs on barley."

	In his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.
	As much as that matters, Kovrig's wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival.
	She says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.
	Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.
	Canada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they've endured their captivity was inspiring.
	""Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, and their families, have shown truly remarkable perseverance in the face of an unimaginable situation,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.
	Kovrig is ""marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength"" to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week.
	""He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,"" she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.
	""He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.""
	A statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.
	The statement said that ""contrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.""
	The statement also said that ""the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.""
	The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor's friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.
	Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada's diplomatic corps, a career-focused on preventing deadly conflicts.
	""He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,"" said Nadjibulla.
	She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy's ""War and Peace,"" to Nelson Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom."" He's reread one of his pre-prison favourites, ""Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.
	""It essentially posits that it's important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it's very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,"" she said.
	Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of ""fear into prudence, pain into information,"" said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added ""anger into determination and grievance into resolve"" to that philosophy.
	He has been drawn to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, ""which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,"" said Nadjibulla.
	Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.
	Robert Malley, Kovrig's boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They're also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.
	Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig's discipline.
	""None of us can be prepared for that, unless you're in the military and you're told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,"" said Malley.
	When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.
	Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton's on-site virtual visit in October -- his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn't allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.
	He was shocked at the pandemic's scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie ""Contagion.""
	Kovrig is also aware that he is one of ""two Michaels"" and understands that both he and Spavor ""are caught in this bigger situation,"" she said. It's not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.
	Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department's attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.
	If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.
	""Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,"" Nadjibulla said. ""They're pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.""

              China restricts U.S. official travel to Hong Kong

              China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/china-restricts-u-s-official-travel-to-hong-kong-1.5225016,"BEIJING -- 
	China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	U.S. diplomatic passport holders visiting Hong Kong and nearby Macao will temporarily no longer receive visa-free entry privileges, spokesperson Hua Chunying said.
	U.S. administration officials, congressional staffers, employees of non-governmental organizations and their immediate family members will face ""reciprocal sanctions,"" Hua said.
	She was apparently referring to U.S. sanctions that bar certain Chinese and Hong Kong officials from travelling to the U.S. or having dealings with the U.S. financial system over their roles in imposing a sweeping National Security Law passed this summer that ushered in a crackdown on free speech and opposition political activity in Hong Kong.
	Hua said the move was taken ""given that the U.S. side is using the Hong Kong issue to seriously interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's core interests.""
	Those sanctioned ""have performed egregiously and are primarily responsible on the Hong Kong issue,"" she said at a daily briefing.
	""China once again urges the U.S. side to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and not go further down the wrong and dangerous path,"" Hua said.
	China had long threatened to retaliate against the U.S. sanctions and other actions seen as hostile.
	Earlier, China's official Xinhua News Agency said Trump administration officials are ""digging a hole"" for the next U.S. administration's relationship with China through actions targeting the country and its officials.
	Steps such as restricting visas for the 92 million members of the ruling Communist Party and their families have ""again exposed the sinister intentions of extreme anti-China forces in Washington to hijack China-U.S. relations for their own political gain,"" Xinhua said in an editorial.
	The U.S. State Department last week cut the duration of such visas from 10 years to one month, another example of the increasingly hard-line stance adopted by the administration in its waning days. That came in addition to the sanctions targeting specific Chinese and Hong Kong officials over their actions in Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has signalled he intends to keep pressure on China, he's also expected to seek a return to more conventional, less confrontational style of diplomacy. Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington's stance toward Beijing.
	""By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-U.S. relations on issues concerning China's core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration's relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains,"" Xinhua said.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.
	Dozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.
	On Wednesday, Pompeo accused U.S. universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was ""poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends.""
	Chinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying U.S. accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.
	Perhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.
	""Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation,"" Xinhua said. ""The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-U.S. relations."""

              Hunter Biden tax probe examining Chinese business dealings

	The Justice Department's investigation scrutinizing Hunter Biden's taxes has been examining some of his Chinese business dealings, among other financial transactions, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	The investigation was launched in 2018, a year before his father, Joe Biden, announced his candidacy for president, but it isn't clear which entities might be tied up in the probe, and the inquiry was not disclosed to Hunter Biden until Tuesday.
	The younger Biden has a history of international affairs and business dealings in a number of countries, and the revelation of a federal investigation puts a renewed spotlight on the questions about his financial dealings that dogged his father's successful White House campaign.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including one for Hunter Biden, according to another person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe. The tax investigation centres on his business dealings, the person said.
	Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to the election because of a Justice Department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts, one of the people said.
	In a statement released by the president-elect's transition office, Hunter Biden said he learned about the investigation on Tuesday, but he did not disclose specifics about what was being scrutinized.
	""I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,"" he said in a statement.
	He has long been a target of President Donald Trump and his allies, who have accused him of profiting off his political connections. Trump and his supporters also raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption related to Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine at the time his father was vice-president and leading the Obama administration's dealings with the Eastern European nation.
	Late Wednesday, Trump tweeted a quote from New York Post columnist Miranda Devine claiming, ""10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.""
			“10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.” Miranda Devine @nypost @TuckerCarlson But I won anyway!
	The disclosure of the federal investigation, led by the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware, comes at an awkward moment for the incoming president, who is assembling his Cabinet. His pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son if it is still ongoing when Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.
	The transition team said in a statement, ""President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	It could also add weight to Trump's broad accusations that Biden was weak on China. Trump took a tough line on China during the campaign as he tried to deflect blame for the coronavirus. Biden has rejected the characterization that he was weak and said, that unlike Trump, he would rebuild global coalitions to check China's power.
	A New Yorker profile on Hunter Biden last year detailed some of his business work in China, including how he accompanied his father on a 2013 trip to Beijing, where he met with a business associate. He also acknowledged having received a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon involved in liquified natural gas projects. He downplayed the idea that the gift could have been intended to affect his father's policy. He told the magazine that he gave the diamond to an associate.
	""What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn't in office,"" he said.
	Hunter Biden has been caught up in controversies before. While his father was vice-president, Hunter joined the Naval Reserve and was discharged after testing positive for cocaine in his system, later revealing a yearslong struggle with addiction.
	He also joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, sparking concerns about the perceptions of a conflict of interest given the elder Biden was deeply involved in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. An investigation by the Republican-led Senate did not identify any policies that were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	In the weeks before the election, Trump supporters used the existence of a laptop they said was connected to Hunter Biden -- and the emergence of someone who maintains he had business discussions with him -- to raise questions about Joe Biden's knowledge of his son's activities in Ukraine and China. The president-elect has said he did not discuss his son's international business dealings with him and has denied having ever taken money from a foreign country.
	The laptop surfaced publicly in October when The New York Post reported on emails that it said had come from Hunter Biden's laptop and that it said it received from Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer.
	A third person familiar with the matter said the tax investigation does not have anything to do with the laptop. Like the other people who spoke to the AP, the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
	In a CNN interview last week, President-elect Biden addressed the business dealings of his son Hunter and his brothers, pledging that they would avoid any perceived conflicts of interest during his time in office.
	""My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict, where there's appropriate distance from the presidency and government,"" Biden said.

	The EU's medicines regulator said Wednesday it had been the victim of a cyberattack, just weeks before it is due to decide on special approval for two coronavirus vaccines.
	The Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the incident was being investigated but did not say exactly when it took place or give details about what was targeted.
	""EMA has been the subject of a cyberattack. The agency has swiftly launched a full investigation, in close cooperation with law enforcement and other relevant entities,"" the EMA said in a brief statement.
	""EMA cannot provide additional details whilst the investigation is ongoing. Further information will be made available in due course.""
	A spokeswoman for the agency referred back to the statement when asked for more details by AFP.
	The EMA has said it will give a decision on conditional approval for Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine at a meeting that will be held by December 29 at the latest.
	A ruling on Moderna's version should follow by January 12.
	The regulator is also carrying out reviews of vaccines developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine and Johnson & Johnson.
	The EMA moved to Amsterdam from London after Britain left the European Union in January 2019. It oversees all medicines for the 27-nation EU.
SERIES OF WARNINGS
	The cyberattack on the EMA comes after a series of warnings about hacking related to the coronavirus pandemic.
	Britain accused Russian-based, Kremlin-linked hackers in July of targeting labs conducting coronavirus vaccine research.
	Cybercriminals have tried to attack several pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca and South Korean laboratories, according to the Wall Street Journal.
	Spanish laboratories also reportedly have been attacked by Chinese cybercriminals, the El Pais newspaper reported in September.
	Microsoft urged a crackdown in November on cyberattacks perpetrated by states and ""malign actors"" after a spate of hacks disrupted healthcare organisations fighting the virus.
	IBM said last week that it too had uncovered a string of attacks, again potentially carried out by state actors, against companies involved in the effort to distribute the vaccine.
	The European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union was one target of the attacks, as well as European and Asian companies involved in the supply chain, IBM said.
	Meanwhile, it is not the first time a Netherlands-based international body has been targeted by hackers.
	Dutch authorities expelled four alleged Russian intelligence agents in 2018 after an alleged bid to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, using equipment in the back of a car parked in a neighbouring hotel."

              Why did Mount Everest's height change?

              China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.

	The world's highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story.
	China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.
	As definitive as that sounds, geological changes, the complicated business of measuring a mountain and varying criteria for determining the world's highest peak will likely ensure the question isn't settled for good.
	The mountain's height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down.
	The countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest's height earlier this year.
	""Nature tends to strike a balance,"" he told the official Xinhua News Agency. As an example, Dang cited a massive 1934 earthquake that wiped out 150 years of steady height increase in a few moments.
	There's more than one way to measure a mountain.
	Last year, a Nepalese team set up a satellite navigation marker on Everest's peak to gauge its exact position via GPS satellites. A Chinese team undertook a similar mission this spring, though it used the Chinese-made Beidou constellation of navigation satellites, along with other equipment.
	At the same time, Nepalese crews took measurements with modern, laser-equipped versions of instruments called theodolites, first used to gauge the mountain's height in 1856 by measuring angles using trigonometry.
	The Nepalese team also used ground penetrating radar to measure the amount of snow and ice that sits on top of its highest rock.
	China and Nepal jointly presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 metres (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The two had diverged for years over the mountain's actual height.
	The new height is 0.86 metres (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries' two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The agreement announced Tuesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between them.
	Measuring the height above sea level has always been tricky because ocean levels vary considerably depending on tides, magnetism and other factors. Rising sea levels are creating another factor for future measurements.
	How high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain's height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills.
	As measured from the Earth's core, Ecuador's Mount Chimborazo is the world's highest, standing more than 2,072 metres (6,800 feet) above Everest. Because the Earth bulges in the middle, mountains along the equator are farther from the core.
	Measuring from the foot of the mountain to the peak, Hawaii's Mauna Kea is the tallest. Most of it, however, is under the sea.
	This story has been corrected to say that the agreement was announced Tuesday, not Wednesday.

	The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.
	The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.
	The UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.
	The UAE's Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they ""have reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""
	""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.
	It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.
	Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.
	The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.
	Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus' spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.
	Top officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.
	Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.
	In transport, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must remain at cold temperatures -- negative 70 degrees Celsius (negative 94 degree Fahrenheit) and negative 20 degrees Celsius (negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively.
	The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people in China had received its vaccine.
	Meanwhile Wednesday, Abu Dhabi announced it would resume ""all economic, tourism, cultural and entertainment activities in the emirate within two weeks."" It attributed the decision to ""successes"" in halting the spread of the coronavirus.
	Abu Dhabi has required those travelling into the emirate from the UAE's other six sheikhdoms to take a coronavirus test within 48 hours prior to arrival.
	Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over 9 million people.
	In Iran, meanwhile, President Hassan Rouhani angrily blamed U.S. sanctions for making it difficult for Tehran to purchase medicine and health supplies amid the pandemic.
	And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the first shipment of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, calling it a ""big day of celebration"" for the country.
	""I believe in this vaccine. I expect it will receive the appropriate approval in the coming days,"" Netanyahu said, adding that he intended to be the first to receive it. ""We see the end of the pandemic.""

	Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are physically and mentally well and showing inspiring resilience as they near the end of their second year of imprisonment by the People's Republic, says Canada's ambassador to China.
	Dominic Barton also says Chinese authorities were paranoid about containing the spread of COVID-19 as they denied consular access to the two men from January to October.
	""Our understanding of why it was the case is that the Chinese are completely paranoid about the virus,"" Barton said in testimony Tuesday night before the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations.
	Barton is leading Canada's efforts in China to win the release of Kovrig and Spavor, who were arrested and imprisoned on Dec. 10, 2018, in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou.
	After months of delay, Barton was most recently granted on-site virtual consular access to Kovrig and Spavor in November, following similar virtual visits with the two Canadians a month earlier.
	""We were obviously very frustrated at not being able to get access even virtually because as far as we know . . . the virus doesn't go through televisions,"" said Barton.
	The Chinese government has charged Kovrig and Spavor with espionage but the Canadian government says their detention is arbitrary and has called repeatedly for their release.
	Barton said it wasn't just Canada that was blocked by the Chinese from visiting prisoners charged in national security cases; the U.S. and Britain faced similar restrictions.
	When Barton was able to see them, he said he was able to verify they were in good physical and mental condition.
	""They are robust,"" said Barton, who was testifying from Beijing via video link. ""You would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Spavor is being held in a prison in the city of Dandong near the North Korean border while Kovrig is in a Beijing area prison.
	""It's a strange thing. We fly to these places, or drive to them in the case of Beijing. And I know that the Michaels (are) literally sort of on the other side of the wall, but you've got, you know, two big TVs,"" he said. ""It's like this.""
	Barton's main purpose for testifying was to describe the three-day Chinese government-controlled visit to Tibet that he and nine other Western diplomats undertook in October. He said he remains concerned about the human rights situation there and that they only saw what the Chinese wanted them to see.
	Even though the area is filled with security cameras, as is the capital of Beijing, Barton said he wandered off a couple of times to visit with locals without his Chinese government minders in tow.
	He said Canada is not reluctant to raise human rights concerns with China even though some people think Canada is in the Chinese ""doghouse"" these days. He also said that even though he knew the visit to Tibet would be controlled, it sent a signal to local people that the outside world still cared about their plight.
	Thursday marked Barton's second appearance before the committee this year, following testimony in February in which he declared ""the chill is real"" in Canadian relations with China.
	In February, Barton described an angry, emotional meeting during his first diplomatic contact with his Chinese counterparts after being appointed to the post in 2019 after a long career in business, which included being the global managing director of the consulting giant McKinsey & Co.
	His position in the company gave Barton high level access in China and across Asia, something the Trudeau government is hoping to leverage to win freedom for Kovrig and Spavor while maintaining economic relations with its second largest trading partner.

              Another judge blocks Trump's TikTok ban; app still in limbo
          
","
              A federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.

	A federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.
	The Trump administration had tried to ban the short-form video app from smartphone app stores in the U.S. and cut it off from vital technical services. TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.
	Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said in a ruling Monday that the Commerce Department ""likely overstepped"" its use of presidential emergency powers ""and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to consider obvious alternatives.""
	Nichols is the second federal judge to fully block the Trump administration's economic sanctions against the app as the court cases proceed.
	The Trump administration has alleged that TikTok is a security threat because the Chinese government could spy on app users' personal data. TikTok has denied it's a security threat but said it's still trying to work with the administration to resolve its concerns.
	Trump in September gave his tentative blessing to a proposal by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns by having the U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart invest in TikTok. Oracle would manage U.S. user data under the arrangement. But a federal agency still has to review and finalize an arrangement.
	A government deadline for ByteDance to complete the deal passed on Friday, and it's not clear what the status of the agreement is.
	The Treasury Department, which chairs the agency reviewing the deal, said Friday that the agency ""is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks arising from the transaction.""
	The Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, it's not clear what his administration will carry on the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to secure a ban, or increase the involvement of U.S. companies."

              The day soccer dyed: Chinese match off because 'hair not black enough'

              A women's university soccer match in China descended into farce and was eventually called off after players were told that they were not allowed to have dyed hair, state media said Tuesday.

	A women's university soccer match in China descended into farce and was eventually called off after players were told that they were not allowed to have dyed hair, state media said Tuesday.
	The incident trended on the Twitter-like Weibo, angering many people, and comes after the men's national team were ordered to cover up their tattoos.
	The latest high-profile example of the shrinking space for individualism in communist-ruled China came when the women's sides of Fuzhou and Jimei universities met in a college league match in the southeastern province of Fujian.
	The teams were reportedly warned about the ban on dyed hair beforehand but as they were getting ready for the match on November 30 officials spotted that players from both sides had failed to heed the reminder.
	At least one Fuzhou University player was then spotted frantically having her hair dyed again in an attempt to return it to its original colour, but it failed to dry in time, the Beijing News said.
	The newspaper, citing someone at the scene who gave the pseudonym Zhang Zhi, said that some Fuzhou players also ran off to a nearby hair salon to buy black hair dye.
	However, one Fuzhou player was deemed ineligible because her hair was ""still not black enough"" so they were unable to field enough players, consequently forfeiting the match 3-0, the report said.
	Fuzhou University declined to comment when contacted by AFP. However, the China News cited the university as saying that the ban on dyed hair was ""in accordance with relevant regulations"" passed down from the education ministry in Beijing.
	""The relevant documents stipulate that players cannot dye their hair, have weird hairstyles or wear any accessories,"" the official said, adding it was a nationwide edict that had already been in place before the match.
	Many on Weibo were aghast at the ruling and the brouhaha trended on the social media network, racking up more than 400 million views.
	""I thought I was reading North Korean news,"" joked one user on Weibo.
	""Am I really living in the 21st Century?"" asked another.
	President Xi Jinping is a soccer fan and has grand plans to make China a leading country in the world's most popular sport.
	However, soccer has found itself in the crosshairs of the Communist Party's drive for a homogenized society.
	Players on the national team routinely cover their arms with long sleeves or bandages to hide their tattoos.
	Body ink is traditionally frowned upon in China but it is increasingly popular among young adults, even as authorities make plain their disdain for it."

	Shares in China's biggest online health care platform rose 50% in their Hong Kong stock market debut Tuesday, reflecting investor enthusiasm for the fledgling industry as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
	JD Health, an arm of JD.Com Inc., China's biggest online retailer, sells medications, hospital care packages and online consulting by doctors.
	Chinese internet companies increasingly offer health services in a society where hospitals are crowded and distribution of drugs and medical supplies outside major cities is uneven. Online consulting with Chinese-speaking physicians is popular with families from China who live in the West or other developing countries.
	Other competitors include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group's Alibaba Health; Baidu Health, run by search giant Baidu.com Inc.; and WeDoctor, run by Tencent Holding, operator of the popular WeChat messaging service.
	The coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for Chinese online platforms.
	Investors have ""high hopes for this kind of companies to develop in China,"" said Jackson Wong, asset management director for Amber Hill Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	The ruling Communist Party has encouraged growth of the industry by authorizing online pharmacies to deliver prescription drugs.
	During the pandemic, patients switched from going online only for urgent care to staying in touch with doctors about chronic conditions, according to industry analyst Kevin Chang of Bain & Co.
	""This new pattern of digital engagements is likely to continue and to increase the frequency of consultations,"" Chang said in a report.
	Consumer spending and business activity have rebounded to above pre-pandemic levels after China, where the pandemic began in December, declared the disease under control in March and eased most controls. Restrictions on travellers coming from abroad still are in place and visitors to public buildings are checked for fever.
	JD Health raised about $3.8 billion by selling 20% of the company to public shareholders.
	It was Hong Kong's second-biggest stock offering this year behind parent JD.Com, which has shares traded in New York and raised $4.5 billion in June when it joined the Hong Kong exchange.
	The ruling party is encouraging use of online health services to reduce the burden on hospitals.
	JD Health said it plans to expand its online pharmacy and develop ""smart healthcare solutions"" supported by artificial intelligence to work with physicians.
	The company says it had 72.5 million active users in June, up 30% over a year earlier.
	The industry might face tougher competition once the coronavirus is brought under control and patients have more offline options, said Wong.
	""If vaccines are very effective and people start going out again, the growth of these online service providers might not be as high,"" said Wong. ""That would be the biggest risk for this kind of company.""

              A year on, markets bustling in Chinese city where COVID-19 emerged
          
","
              Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.

	Hundreds of shoppers pack a wet market on a December weekday morning in the Chinese city of Wuhan, jostling to buy fresh vegetables and live fish, frogs and turtles.
	Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.
	""I'm not afraid, what is there to be afraid of?"" said Nie Guangzhen, a fish and vegetable vendor.
	Nie and other shop owners along a narrow street, part of the larger wet market, were busily gutting fish for streams of buyers - some not wearing masks - as city cleaners sprayed down the pavements.
	Few hints remain of Wuhan's early role in the coronavirus pandemic, which has since infected more than 67 million people globally, killing around 1.5 million people.
	China first alerted the World Health Organization to 27 cases of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan on Dec. 31. Authorities shut down a wet market in the city the next day, after discovering some patients were vendors or dealers.
	That marked the start of a dark period for the city of 11 million in central China. Infections spiraled quickly to 50,000 cases, including almost 4,000 deaths. Officials responded by swiftly imposing a tough 76-day lockdown, erecting kilometers of thick yellow barricades through the city's deserted streets to keep people at home and businesses closed.
	The measures paid off. Wuhan has not recorded a new locally transmitted case in several months and is now indistinguishable from other Chinese cities with crowded shopping streets, traffic jams and tightly packed restaurants.
	""I really missed these more fun and exciting times, like going out shopping and eating with my friends,"" said 27-year-old shopper Hu Hang on Monday at a packed Wuhan night market selling Christmas sweaters among other goods.
	In the busy street, hawkers sell flowers and balloons, street performers including dancers and a clown perform while music blares from shops lining the road.
	The city's recovery is a sharp contrast to other major economies heading into the Christmas and New year holiday season.
	In the United States, the health system is under severe pressure as cases mount and health officials warn the worst is yet to come. The country recorded 15,000 deaths over the past week, the deadliest seven days of the pandemic since April.
	Several European countries have rolled out tight restrictions on gatherings ahead of Christmas, fearing a return to peak levels of cases because of festive celebrations.
	China's relative success in controlling the virus has become a key talking point in Chinese state media.
	""I haven't been overseas, so I don't understand it well, but looking at the TV it seems like foreign countries don't put human life first,"" said Mr Li, a 54-year old Wuhan street food vendor, who reopened his shop in June. ""The ideology of foreign countries is not as good as that of China.""
	China has taken steps, including mass testing millions of residents following small-scale outbreaks, to prevent a second wave of infections seen in many other cities and countries.
	At the gates of residential compounds, staff in blue tents monitor residents' smartphone health codes. In a public park, slogans on red propaganda banners urge people to remain vigilant.
	Wearing face masks is not mandatory, but most people do so in public.
	And while shoppers have returned to Wuhan's streets, Li and others say business is yet to return fully to normal.
	""The whole situation is not great, it's still a lot worse compared to the last few years,"" Li said, referring to a slump in sales during the time after lockdown when people were too afraid to return to the streets.
	Still, for many residents, lockdown memories have been superseded by the city's swift reopening - alongside new precautions.
	""I don't worry, because I'm doing a good job of protection,"" said wet market vendor Nie, who said she will continue to disinfect and boil her clothes. ""Even if there is a second wave, I will just stick to it.”

              China, Nepal say Everest a bit higher than past measurements
          
","
              China and Nepal jointly announced a new official height for Mount Everest on Tuesday, ending a discrepancy between the two nations.

                  Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/china-nepal-say-everest-a-bit-higher-than-past-measurements-1.5221438,"KATHMANDU, NEPAL -- 
	China and Nepal jointly announced a new official height for Mount Everest on Tuesday, ending a discrepancy between the two nations.
	The new height of the world's highest peak is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 feet), which is slightly more than Nepal's previous measurement and about four meters (13 feet) higher than China's.
	Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Nepalese counterpart, Pradeep Gyawali, simultaneously pressed buttons during a virtual conference and the new height flashed on the screen.
	The height of Everest, which is on the border between China and Nepal, was agreed on after surveyors from Nepal scaled the peak in 2019 and a Chinese team did the same in 2020.
	There had been debate over the actual height of the peak and concern that it might have shrunk after a major earthquake in 2015. The quake killed 9,000 people, damaged about 1 million structures in Nepal and triggered an avalanche on Everest that killed 19 people at the base camp.
	There was no doubt that Everest would remain the highest peak because the second highest, Mount K2, is only 8,611 metres (28,244 feet) tall.
	Everest's height was first determined by a British team around 1856 as 8,842 metres (29,002) feet.
	But the most accepted height has been 8,848 metres (29,028 feet), which was determined by the Survey of India in 1954.
	In 1999, a National Geographic Society team using GPS technology came up with a height of 8,850 (29,035 feet). A Chinese team in 2005 said it was 8,844.43 metres (29,009 feet) because it did not include the snow cap.
	A Nepal government team of climbers and surveyors scaled Everest in May 2019 and installed GPS and satellite equipment to measure the peak and snow depth on the summit.
	Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Nepal later that year and the leaders of the two countries decided that they should agree on a height.
	A survey team from China then conducted measurements in the spring of 2020 while all other expeditions were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
	Nepal's climbing community welcomed the end of confusion over the mountain's height.
	""This is a milestone in mountaineering history which will finally end the debate over the height and now the world will have one number,"" said Santa Bir Lama, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.
	China's official Xinhua New Agency quoted Xi as saying the two sides are committed to jointly protecting the environment around Everest and co-operating in scientific research.
	For China, the announcement appeared to be as much about politics as geography. China has drawn Nepal ever closer into its orbit with investments in its economy and the building of highways, dams, airports and other infrastructure in the impoverished nation.
	That appears to serve China's interests in reducing the influence of rival India, with which it shares a disputed border, and Nepal's role as a destination for refugee Tibetans.
	The Xinhua report said nothing about the technical aspects but heavily emphasized the joint announcement's geopolitical weight.
	China and Nepal will establish an ""even closer community of a shared future to enrich the countries and their peoples,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying."

	China's politically sensitive trade surplus soared to a record US$75.4 billion in November as exports surged 21.1% over a year earlier, propelled by American consumer demand.
	Exports to the United States rose 46% despite lingering tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington, customs data showed Monday.
	Total exports rose to $268 billion, accelerating from October's 11.4% growth. Imports gained 5% to $192.6 billion, up from the previous month's 4.7%.
	Chinese exporters have benefited from the economy's relatively early reopening after the Communist Party declared the coronavirus pandemic under control in March while foreign competitors still are hampered by anti-disease controls.
	“Exports were much stronger than expected in November,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.
	Forecasters say that surge is unlikely to last into 2021 once coronavirus vaccines are rolled out.
	“We expect export performance to be less impressive,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.
	China's global trade surplus for the first 11 months of 2020 is $460 billion, up 21.4% from this time last year, already one of the highest ever recorded.
	Exports to the United States rose to $51.9 billion while imports of American goods gained 33% to $14.6 billion. The trade surplus with the United States swelled 52% over a year earlier to $37.3 billion.
	Beijing promised to buy more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports as part of the “Phase 1” agreement signed in January and aimed at ending a costly tariff battle over Chinese technology ambitions. China fell behind on meeting those commitments earlier in the year but is catching up as demand rebounds.
	The two governments agreed to postpone further planned tariff hikes on each other's goods but most penalties already imposed on billions of dollars of imports stayed in place.
	Chinese imports are growing faster by volume than by value because demand has been chilled by the shutdown of travel and industry, driving prices lower.
	China is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan falls.
	China's economy shrank by 6.8% from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2% in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9% in the three months ending in September.
	Automakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other raw materials. Retail sales are back above pre-virus levels and rose 4.3% over a year earlier in October.
	Also in November, exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 8.6% over a year ago to $37.5 billion while imports of European goods gained 4.5% to $26.2 billion. China's trade surplus with Europe widened by 20% to $11.3 billion."

	Canada's main stock index moved to within two per cent of a record high Monday on gains in the materials and technology sectors.
	Gold and silver prices increased, partly on expectations that U.S. politicians will agree to additional fiscal stimulus, said Angelo Kourkafas, analyst on the investment strategy team at Edward Jones.
	In addition, there are renewed geopolitical concerns about ongoing Brexit negotiations ahead of Wednesday's deadline and the potential for new U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials over the crackdown on Hong Kong.
	The February gold contract was up US$26.00 at US$1,866.00 an ounce and the March copper contract was down 0.8 of a cent at almost US$3.52 a pound.
	Materials rose 2.1 per cent as shares of Oceanagold Corp. surged 31.9 per cent while Kinross Gold Corp. were up 7.5 per cent.
	The improved performance of Canada's technology sector and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite in the U.S. were attributable to worsening coronavirus trends and lockdowns on both sides of the border, Kourkafas said.
	""The focus and the market's attention ... is looking forward for the vaccine potential distribution. And that continues to be the main driver of sentiment,"" he said in an interview.
	Canadian and U.S health regulators are expected to soon grant emergency authorization for at least two vaccines presented by Pfizer and Moderna. A third vaccine has also been developed by AstraZeneca.
	Technology rose 1.3 per cent with shares of Shopify Inc. up 2.9 per cent.
	""We have seen this kind of tug-of-war between vaccine optimism and worsening coronavirus trends and clearly the focus now, especially in the U.S., is turning to the negotiations in Washington.""
	The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 61.38 points to 17,582.35. It hit an intraday high of 17,611.48 that is less than two per cent or 359 points below February's record high.
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 148.47 points at 30,069.79. The S&P 500 index was down 7.16 points at 3,691.96, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was up 55.72 points at 12,519.95.
	The Canadian dollar was unchanged from Friday at 78.12 cents US.
	The January crude contract was down 50 cents at US$45.76 per barrel and the January natural gas contract was down 16.9 cents at nearly US$2.41 per mmBTU.
	Lower prices pushed the energy sector down 0.9 per cent with Tourmaline Oil Corp. off 5.1 per cent. The price fall is attributable to concerns about demand as new restrictions in movement translates into lower demand for travel and a pullback after last week's strong oil price gains.
	""So we're seeing kind of that effect of the renewed restrictions show up in a little bit of a loss of momentum in the economic data. And we expect that to likely persist for the remainder of the year and likely the first quarter of next year,"" said Kourkafas.

	Chinese vaccine company Sinovac announced Monday that it is planning to complete a new facility to double its annual vaccine production capacity to 600 million doses by the end of the year, while also securing a US$500 million investment in a boost to its COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.
	The company is currently conducting the last stage of clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia and is among the frontrunners of China' s vaccine efforts. China has at least five COVID-19 vaccine candidates running late stage clinical trials across more than a dozen countries.
	Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd., a pharmaceutical conglomerate, bought a 15% stake in Sinovac for an investment of $500 million. The funds will allow the company to ""improve our vaccine sales capabilities, expand in Asia markets, develop and access new technologies, and most importantly, accelerate our efforts to help combat the global pandemic,"" Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong said in a statement.
	On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of its experimental vaccine arrived in Indonesia and are expected to be approved for use soon.
	Sinovac's candidate is a two-dose inactivated vaccine, an old-school technology in which a live virus is killed and then purified. It can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F), within the range of a normal refrigerator, unlike some other vaccines candidates that require far lower temperatures.
	Sinovac's experimental vaccine is currently approved for emergency use in China, although it has not yet obtained final market approval. Under emergency use, it has been distributed to groups the Chinese government deemed suitable, including front-line medical workers and border personnel.
	The latest public data from the company, published in the science journal Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who have recovered from COVID-19."

Chinese probe orbiting moon with Earth-bound samples

              A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.

	A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.
	The ascent module of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft transferred a container with 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of samples after docking with the robot spacecraft on Sunday and was then cut free.
	The orbiter and reentry vehicle will circle the moon for another week awaiting a narrow time window to make the roughly three-day, 383,000-kilometre (238,000-mile) journey back to Earth. It will first ""bounce"" off the Earth's atmosphere to slow its speed before the reentry vehicle separates and floats down on parachutes to land on the vast steppes of Inner Mongolia, where China's Shenzhou crewed spaceships have also made their landings.
	If the mission succeeds, it will make China the third country after the United States and former Soviet Union to bring moon rocks to Earth. They will be the first fresh samples of the lunar surface obtained by scientists since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 probe in 1976.
	The Chang'e 5 ascent stage blasted off from the moon's surface on Friday, leaving behind the lander module flying the Chinese flag, according to the China National Space Agency, which also released a photo taken by the orbiter showing it approaching for its rendezvous with the ascender, a sliver of the Earth seen in the background.
	That marked the first time China had succeeded in lifting off a spacecraft from a celestial body, while no country had previously achieved the tricky feat of executing a robotic docking in lunar orbit. Controllers on Earth had to deal with distance and time lag while precisely manoeuvring a clamp into position with almost no room for error.
	The 23-day mission has been front page news in state media for days, paired with reports that China has officially lifted all of its citizens out of the most grinding form of poverty. Along with being a propaganda coup for the ruling Communist Party, the dual stories illustrate the vast economic and technological advances China has made since it became just the third country in history to launch a person into space in 2003.
	Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying praised the ""courage to explore, overcome difficulties and pay hard efforts"" of those who made the mission possible.
	""The entirety of the Chinese people are proud of the efforts and wisdom of the Chinese lunar exploration researchers,"" Hua told reporters Monday at a daily briefing.
	By way of cautious incremental steps, China is now in the midst of a series of ambitious missions that include a probe en route to Mars and the development of a reusable space plane about which little information has been provided.
	The Chang'e lunar program, named after the ancient Chinese moon goddess, has also been operating the Chang'e 4 probe on the moon's less explored far side for the past two years, while the Chang'e 3 rover launched seven years ago continues to send back data.
	Future plans call for returning a human to the moon five decades after American astronauts, along with a possible permanent moon base, although no timeline has been offered. China is also building a permanent space station to begin operating as early as 2022.
	U.S. opposition has prevented China's secretive, military-backed program from participating in the International Space Station, although the CNSA has been expanding its ties with other programs, including the European Space Agency, which has helped guide Chang'e 5 on its mission.
	Chang'e 5 touched down Dec. 1 on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side close to a formation called the Mons Rumker, an area believed to have been the site of ancient volcanic activity.
	The rocks and other debris were obtained both by drilling into the moon's crust and by scooping directly off the surface. They are thought to possibly be billions of years younger than those brought back earlier and may offer insights into the moon's history as well as that of other bodies in our solar system.
	The lunar exploration program has set up dedicated labs to analyze the samples for age and composition. China is also expected to share some part of them with other countries, as was done with the hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of rocks, sand, dust and other samples obtained by the U.S. and the former Soviet Union."

              China prepares large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccines
          
","
              Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country's 1.4 billion people.

	Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country's 1.4 billion people.
	Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a UN meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.
	Even without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.
	China's fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.
	On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of the Chinese company Sinovac's vaccine arrived in Indonesia, the government said.
	""We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,"" President Joko Widodo said.
	Within China, so far only one developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine. Others have been approved for emergency use on people deemed at high risk of infection.
	""We must be prepared for large-scale production,"" Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
	Sun, who has as overseen much of the country's response, visited one of Sinopharm's Beijing subsidiary companies, Sinovac and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.
	The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month.
	The companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers.
	They say unlike Pfizer's vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.
	Health experts question why China is using experimental vaccines on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.
	Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.
	The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use.
	Authorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.
	The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).
	Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.
	In October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority.
	In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.
	In September, Sinovac's CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.
	Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.
	Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.
	Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.
	A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China.

              A potential return for Meng may not guarantee release of Kovrig, Spavor: experts 
          
","
              If a deal is made and Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is allowed to go home, will two detained Canadians be released? Experts weigh in on the possibilities.
        ","
                  Saturday, Dec. 5, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/a-potential-return-for-meng-may-not-guarantee-release-of-kovrig-spavor-experts-1.5218787,"OTTAWA -- 
	Almost two years after Meng Wanzhou’s arrest in Vancouver's airport, the Huawei executive could be heading home soon.
	According to reports from the Wall Street Journal, the United States Department of Justice is ready to make a deal with the telecom giant, offering Meng a deferred prosecution agreement and allow her to return to China in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing in her ongoing criminal case.
	This could be welcome news for Canada, as Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been detained in China since Meng’s arrest, in what has widely been seen as retaliation from the Chinese government. Canada has also been subject to trade sanctions on canola, soybean, beef, and pork exports, leading to a 16 per cent decline of exports to China in 2019.
	""If she is returned, it opens the door for releasing the two Canadians, and I think that Ottawa is probably busy speaking with Washington and Beijing to try and make sure the solution will be a triangular one,"" said former Canadian ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques.
	However, experts are divided on how soon the Michaels will come home, or if they’ll be released in exchange at all.
	""The idealist in me says perhaps, but the realist says no,"" former diplomat Colin Robertson told CTV News.
	Robertson said this potential deal is only the first step as negotiations with China are always a long process.
	""We look at negotiations through different ends of the telescope and that can lead to misunderstandings,"" he said. ""It can also lead to false optimism, which is I'm afraid we might be encouraging right now.""
	One issue complicating the return of the Michaels is the consistent denial from the Chinese that their detentions were related to Meng's arrest, said Robertson.
	In June, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference: ""The Meng Wanzhou incident is in essence difference from the cases of the Canadians.""
	According to Zhao, ""the United States aims to oppress Huawei and other Chinese high-tech companies, and Canada is its accomplice.""
	""This is really between the United States and Ms. Meng,"" said Charles Burton, associate professor at Brock University and MacDonald-Laurier Institute senior fellow.
	""Would the Chinese authorities release Kovrig and Spavor, or would they continue to hold them to continue to exert pressure over Canada with regard to other political matters?""
	Though China has said in the past Meng's release ""could open up space"" to resolve Kovrig and Spavor's detention, the reports of the potential deal so far do not include any guarantees for the Canadians' return.
	""That's why we have to try and get as much undertakings from the Americans if they do decide to proceed down this road…that the Michaels are part of it,"" said Robertson.
	While it was U.S. President Donald Trump who issued Meng's extradition request, the incoming Biden administration is expected to remain tough on China. Robertson said the Canadian government needs to continue to press the Americans to make sure Kovrig and Spavor aren't forgotten once the Meng affair is resolved.
	""We've been left holding the bag,"" said Robertson.
	""We've been used by the Americans and we've certainly been abused by the Chinese, and the two Michaels are the real victims in this whole tragedy."""

              Bahrain now 2nd nation to grant Pfizer shot emergency use
          
","
              The island kingdom of Bahrain said Friday it has become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.

	The island kingdom of Bahrain said Friday it has become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.
	The state-run Bahrain News Agency made the announcement on Friday night, following an earlier announcement by the United Kingdom on Wednesday, making Britain the first in the world.
	""The confirmation of approval by the National Health Regulatory Authority of the kingdom of Bahrain followed thorough analysis and review undertaken by the authority of all available data,"" the kingdom said on its state-run Bahrain News Agency.
	Bahrain did not say how may vaccines it has purchased, nor when vaccinations would begin. It did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	Pfizer later told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the ""timing of delivery and the volume of doses,"" was confidential and declined to comment.
	""We have developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support effective vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring, Pfizer said. ""Our distribution is built on a flexible just in time system which will ship the frozen vials to the point of vaccination.""
	The immediate challenge for Bahrain would be the conditions in which the vaccine must be kept. They must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit). Bahrain is a Mideast nation that regularly sees temperatures in the summer of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity.
	Bahrain does have a state-owned carrier, Gulf Air, that it could use to transport the vaccines. In the nearby United Arab Emirates, the Dubai-based long-haul carrier Emirates has already said it is preparing its facilities to distribute vaccines at ultra-cold temperatures.
	The vaccine also requires two doses be given three weeks apart.
	Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculate some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine, an ""inactivated"" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it, also is in use in the UAE.
	""The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to the kingdom's national COVID-19 response, which has strongly prioritized protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic,"" said Dr. Mariam al-Jalahma, the CEO of Bahrain's National Health Regulatory Authority.
	BioNTech, which owns the vaccine, said it has so far signed deals to supply 570 million doses worldwide in 2021, with options to deliver 600 million more. It hopes to supply at least 1.3 billion in 2021.
	Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is a small island off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf.
	With a population of 1.6 million, it has reported more than 87,000 cases and 341 deaths, according to the government. Over 85,000 people have recovered from the COVID-19 illness that is caused by the virus.
	The country is also home to a large expatriate population, with many low-paid labourers from southeast Asia living in tight housing. In July, authorities told the AP they had moved 8,000 labourers to new accommodations, disinfected housing and implemented a rule requiring no more than five labourers per room, with about 3 metres (10 feet) of space for each one.
	The Bahraini government says it has conducted over 2 million coronavirus tests across the island. It initially blamed its higher per-capita infection rate on that."

	The top U.S. intelligence official stepped up the Trump administration's harsh attacks on Beijing on Thursday, labelling China the biggest threat to democracy and freedom worldwide since the Second World War and saying it was bent on global domination.
	""The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,"" Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said in an opinion article on the Wall Street Journal website.
	Ratcliffe, a former Republican congressman appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump to the top U.S. spy job last spring, said China posed ""the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War Two.""
	He said he had shifted resources within the US$85 billion annual federal budget allocated to intelligence to increase the focus on China.
	Ratcliffe said China's economic espionage approach was threefold: ""Rob, Replicate and Replace.""
	He said the strategy was for Chinese entities to steal American companies' intellectual property, copy it and then supplant U.S. companies in the global market place.
	A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy rejected Ratcliffe's comments as ""fact-distorting"" and hypocritical and said they showed ""the entrenched Cold-War mindset and ideological prejudices of some people on the U.S. side.""
	Beijing has frequently called on U.S. leaders to dial back their rhetoric on China, which it blames on fear of China's growing role in the world.
	Ratcliffe's essay was the latest broadside against China from Trump's administration as it seeks to cement the outgoing president's tough-on-China legacy following his Nov. 3 election defeat.
	Trump's approach has taken relations between the world's two largest economies to their lowest point in decades and analysts say it could limit the incoming Biden administration's room for manoeuvre in dealing with Beijing.
	Ratcliffe alluded to reports collected by U.S. intelligence agencies that Chinese representatives have sought to interfere in U.S. domestic politics.
	He also charged that China had stolen U.S. defense technology to fuel President Xi Jinping's aggressive military modernization plans.
	""The election is over. Now let’s all be honest about China,"" Ratcliffe told Reuters after the article was published.
	Among other issues, Washington and Beijing have clashed over China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, its tightening grip on Hong Kong, its disputed claims in the South China Sea, trade and accusations of human rights crimes in Xinjiang.
	Ratcliffe, who served only briefly on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee before Trump appointed him to his role, has been accused by Democrats and current and former intelligence officials of politicizing intelligence.
	In his essay, Ratcliffe said Chinese authorities had ""conducted human testing"" on members of the Chinese army ""in hopes of developing soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities."" He did not elaborate.
	U.S.-based think tanks have reported that China is giving increasing importance to biotechnology in its military strategy but they have not released detailed reports about the kind of testing alleged by Ratcliffe.
	On Thursday, the Trump administration restricted travel to the United States by members of China's ruling Communist Party and their families.
	On Wednesday, it banned cotton imports from a quasi-military organization in Xinjiang it says uses forced labor of detained Muslims, while the House passed a law to kick Chinese firms off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not comply with auditing rules.
	China accused U.S. politicians of fabricating news of detained Muslims being forced into labor in Xinjiang.
	In an emailed statement, the embassy spokesperson said ""no one deserves the title of Empire of Hacking and Spying better than the U.S."" and charged that both the U.S. government and U.S. firms had long carried out ""large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber theft, surveillance and attack.""
	Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said Ratcliffe's comments appeared aimed at locking in a tough approach before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
	""It does appear to part of a broader effort to tie Biden's hands and limit his room to maneuver on China policy,"" she said.
	""In prior administrations, the norm has been to avoid taking such actions during a presidential transition, but the Trump administration has long set a pattern of bucking the norm."" "

	Turkey also has ordered 1 million doses of the vaccine developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German company BioNTech. Erdogan said he spoke with BioNTech co-founder Ugur Sahin, who is of Turkish descent.
	Turkey is experiencing a surge in infections with confirmed cases hovering above 30,000 per day on a 7-day average. The country's death toll since March has reached 14,316. A weekend lockdown, the first since the end of May, is set to begin Friday evening."

	China's senior diplomat in Australia said Prime Minister Scott Morrison overreacted to a social media post about alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, adding that his actions drew more attention to the report.
	Earlier this week, Morrison said that a Chinese official's tweet showing the fake image of an Australian soldier appearing to slit a child's throat was ""truly repugnant"" and merits an apology, which has not come from China.
	""I think it's unfortunate that this issue evolved in such a way that has gone astray and now there is a much larger visibility of the Brereton report in China,"" China's deputy ambassador, Wang Xining, said Friday. ""More people are attentive to what happened in Afghanistan. People wonder why a national leader would have such a strong opinion to an artwork done by a normal young artist in China.""
	He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month that found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the conflict in Afghanistan. It recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.
	It followed a four-year investigation by Maj. Gen. Paul Brereton, a judge and army reservist who was asked to look into the allegations and interviewed more than 400 witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.
	Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, posted the graphic image that shows a grinning soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of a veiled child, who is holding a lamb.
	Zhao wrote a caption with the tweet saying: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.""
	Many of Australia's allies have been critical of the tweet, with the European Union calling it ""irresponsible.""
	""We consider the deliberate dissemination of a fabricated image via social media accounts affiliated with China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be irresponsible, insensitive, and not at all constructive, particularly given the subject in question,"" said an EU spokesman.
	""Such behaviour and use of information tools to disseminate fabricated images or information cannot be justified.""
	Officials from the United States, New Zealand and Canada have also criticized the Chinese tweet.
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports, most recently to its lucrative wine industry."

	The U.S. government has stepped up a feud with Beijing over security by adding China's biggest processor chip maker and a state-owned oil giant to a blacklist that limits access to American technology and investment.
	Thursday's announcement adds to steps taken by U.S. President Donald Trump against China since losing his re-election bid Nov. 3. Political analysts have said Trump was likely to take further action before President-elect Joe Biden takes office Jan. 20.
	The Pentagon added four companies including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. to a list of entities deemed to be part of efforts to modernize the ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army. That raises the total number of companies on the blacklist to 35.
	SMIC plays a leading role in the ruling party's effort to reduce reliance on U.S. and other foreign technology by creating Chinese suppliers of processor chips and other components.
	China's government has criticized such restrictions as an abuse of national security arguments to handicap fledgling Chinese competitors in technology and other fields.
	That has taken on greater urgency after Washington blocked access to American chips and other technology for telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. and imposed curbs on other Chinese buyers. The White House also has blocked the use of U.S. technology by global vendors to produce chips for Huawei.
	CNOOC is the smallest of China's three main state-owned oil producers.
	Political analysts expect little change in policy under Biden due to widespread frustration with China's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.
	The 2.3 million-member PLA is one of the world's biggest and best-armed militaries. It is spending heavily to develop nuclear submarines, stealth fighters, ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons.
	The Pentagon's first list of 20 companies deemed to be PLA-linked in June included Huawei and video surveillance provider HikVision Digital Technology Co. Both say they never have taken part in military-related research.

Chinese spacecraft carrying lunar rocks lifts off from moon

	A Chinese spacecraft lifted off from the moon Thursday night with a load of lunar rocks, the first stage of its return to Earth, the government space agency reported.
	Chang'e 5, the third Chinese spacecraft to land on the moon and the first to take off from it again, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a orbiter and rover headed to Mars.
	The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side. Its mission: collect about 2 kilograms (4 pounds) of lunar rocks and bring them back to Earth, the first return of samples since Soviet spacecraft did so in the 1970s. Earlier, the U.S. Apollo astronauts brought back hundreds of pounds of moon rocks.
	The landing site is near a formation called the Mons Rumker and may contain rocks billions of years younger than those retrieved earlier.
	The ascent vehicle lifted off from the moon shortly after 11 p.m. Beijing time Thursday (1500 GMT) and was due to rendezvous with a return vehicle in lunar orbit, then transfer the samples to a capsule, according to the China National Space Administration. The moon rocks and debris were sealed inside a special canister to avoid contamination.
	It wasn't clear when the linkup would occur. After the transfer, the ascent module would be ejected and the capsule would remain in lunar orbit for about a week, awaiting the optimal time to make the trip back to Earth.
	Chinese officials have said the capsule with the samples is due to land on Earth around the middle of the month. Touchdown is planned for the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's astronauts have made their return in Shenzhou spacecraft.
	Chang'e 5's lander, which remained on the moon, was capable of scooping samples from the surface and drilling 2 metres (about 6 feet).
	While retrieving samples was its main task, the lander also was equipped to extensively photograph the area, map conditions below the surface with ground penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.
	Right before the ascent vehicle lifted off, the lander unfurled what the space administration called the first free-standing Chinese flag on the moon. The agency posted an image -- apparently taken from the lander -- of the ascend vehicle firing its engines as it took off.
	Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending astronauts to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.
	China launched its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.
	While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by U.S. concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program."

              Burner phones and banking apps: Meet the Chinese 'brokers' laundering Mexican drug money

              U.S. law enforcement officials  say small cells of Chinese criminals have upended the way narcotics cash is laundered and are displacing the Mexican and Colombian money men that have long dominated the trade.

	Early next year, a Chinese businessman named Gan Xianbing will be sentenced in a Chicago courtroom for laundering just over US$530,000 in Mexican cartel drug money.
	Gan, 50, was convicted in February of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transfer business that whisked cartel cash from U.S. drug sales offshore. Gan has maintained his innocence; his lawyers say he was entrapped by U.S. authorities. The trial garnered few headlines and little of the public fascination reserved for kingpins of powerful narcotics syndicates that U.S. federal prosecutors said Gan served.
	Still, U.S. law enforcement officials told Reuters that Chinese ""money brokers"" such as Gan represent one of the most worrisome new threats in their war on drugs. They say small cells of Chinese criminals have upended the way narcotics cash is laundered and are displacing the Mexican and Colombian money men that have long dominated the trade.
	Virtually unheard of a decade ago, these Chinese players are moving vast sums quickly and quietly, authorities said. Their expertise: routing cartel drug profits from the United States to China then on to Mexico with a few clicks of a burner phone and Chinese banking apps – and without the bulky cash ever crossing borders. The launderers pay small Chinese-owned businesses in the United States and Mexico to help them move the funds. Most contact with the banking system happens in China, a veritable black hole for U.S. and Mexican authorities.
	Chinese money brokers based in Mexico ""have come to dominate international money laundering markets,"" U.S. prosecutors said in a Sept. 24 sentencing memorandum for Gan's case.
	Reuters spoke to more than a dozen law enforcement officials, diplomats, lawyers and sources familiar with the Gan case or Chinese money laundering techniques. The news organization also examined more than 1,500 pages of documents from the trial. The material included previously unreported details about how the ring operated compiled by prosecutors and agents of Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that led the probe.
	What emerged was a blueprint showing how some groups of Chinese money brokers have become key cogs in the multi-billion-dollar drug empires run by Latin American cartels. The Chinese role presents a formidable challenge for U.S. anti-narcotics efforts at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.
	Gan, who U.S. prosecutors said operated a tight ring with another Chinese money broker, was apprehended in November 2018 by Homeland Security Investigations agents at Los Angeles International Airport on his way to Mexico from Hong Kong. The U.S. government said that Gan had moved anywhere from $25 million to $65 million in illicit drug proceeds from 2016 to the time of his arrest, according to a September court filing by Gan's attorneys.
	Based in Guadalajara, the ring is believed to have worked with multiple syndicates, including the famed Sinaloa Cartel that was previously led by jailed Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to two U.S.-based sources familiar with the investigation.
	The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Europol, the European Union's law enforcement arm, have warned about the expanding web of Chinese crime groups laundering drug money. Europol in November 2019 said these groups present a ""growing threat to Europe,"" while the U.S. Treasury in February placed Chinese professional money laundering networks on its list of ""key threats"" and vulnerabilities within the U.S. financial system.
	U.S. law enforcement has stepped up operations against these groups. In addition to the Gan case in Illinois, federal prosecutors have brought charges in Virginia and Oregon against alleged members of at least two other Chinese money laundering rings since October of last year. Those cases are pending.
	Still, a senior U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent said U.S. efforts to nail Latin American drug capos by following the money have gotten much more difficult.
	""I can't emphasize this enough, the involvement of the Chinese has really complicated all of these schemes,"" the DEA official said.
	Gan, who declined to testify in court, pleaded not guilty to three counts of money laundering, one count of conspiracy to launder money and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was acquitted on the conspiracy charge. Reuters did not receive a reply to requests for comment from Gan sent to his legal team.
	His lawyers, in a September sentencing plea document, said Gan was not the mastermind of the operation, rather a seafood exporter who was duped into letting his bank account in China be used to launder money by another Mexico-based Chinese national named Pan Haiping. Glenn Seiden, Gan's lawyer, declined to speak with Reuters or answer questions about Gan's case.
	Attorney Aaron Schwartz, who was part of the defense team, said he wanted to make it clear that Gan did not cooperate with the U.S. government because his client feared for the safety of his family in Guadalajara, where the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel holds sway. Gan's lawyers also allege Gan was entrapped in a sting operation by Homeland Security Investigations agents working with an informant who helped arrange the transactions that resulted in their client's conviction. The agency said it does not comment on ongoing investigations.
	Pan Haiping, Gan's alleged associate, was detained earlier this year in Mexico on accusations of money laundering and is awaiting extradition to the United States, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and a senior Mexican federal police source. Pan Haiping could not be reached for comment. The Mexican prosecutor's office declined to comment on Pan Haiping's case or provide the name of his legal counsel in Mexico, saying it cannot comment on ongoing cases.
	In a March 2019 U.S. indictment unsealed a few weeks ago, Pan Haiping was charged with laundering almost $500,000 for Mexican cartels; running an illegal money transmitting business in Illinois; and conspiring to launder money using bank accounts in China, including an account belonging to Gan.
	Another alleged conspirator, Long Huanxin, was arrested in February at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian law enforcement acting on a warrant from U.S. authorities, according to Canadian court transcripts from Long's detention hearing. Long was extradited to the United States, and last month he pleaded not guilty in Chicago to charges of money laundering for Mexican cartels, U.S. court documents show. Long's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
	U.S officials informally sought assistance from China in the Gan case but received no support in their investigation, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the probe.
	China's Foreign Ministry disputed their account. The ministry told Reuters in late October that it did not receive a request from U.S. authorities for help on that case. China stands ready to cooperate with the United States to ""destroy drug cartels and drug-related money-laundering networks,"" the ministry said in a statement. But it stressed the need for the two countries to work on the ""principle of respecting each other's laws, equality and mutual benefit,"" the statement said.
	The ministry said most Chinese bank-account holders about whom Washington has inquired as part of its money laundering investigations in recent years were ""legitimate enterprises and individuals"" in China. ""After we asked the U.S. side to provide drug-related clues or evidence of enterprises and individuals, the U.S. side has not responded,"" China's Foreign Ministry said in the statement.
	Without help from Beijing to track money flows in China and to infiltrate the laundering networks, U.S. agents say they face an uphill struggle to catch culprits.
	""It's the most sophisticated form of money laundering that's ever existed,"" one of the U.S. sources familiar with the investigation said.
	Key to cracking the case was Lim Seok Pheng, a New York-based member of the ring who became a cooperating witness for the U.S. government following her May 2018 arrest on suspicion of money laundering.
	A Singapore national, Lim said at Gan's trial that she once peddled footwear and had first met Gan in China where he ran a shoe factory before he relocated to Guadalajara in 2011. Lim testified that Gan recruited her to join the illicit operation in 2016 and that she became lovers with the other alleged ringleader, Pan Haiping.
	Following her arrest at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, Lim agreed to wear a recording device to help authorities gather evidence against Gan and the other alleged conspirators. She also brought undercover Homeland Security Investigations agents into the operation as money couriers on three separate cash pick-ups in Chicago that led to Gan's conviction, according to the trial testimony of Lim and the agents.
	Lim pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in November 2019 and is out on bail, awaiting sentencing.
	She and her attorney declined to comment.
	The only thing tougher than moving illegal drugs across borders is getting the profits back to Mexico's cartels, U.S. officials said. Cash is heavy, and transporting it exposes traffickers to lots of risk. Putting it into the banking system is perilous, too. The U.S. and Mexican financial systems have been geared to detect dirty money.
	Prosecutors told the court that Gan and his accomplices sidestepped these obstacles by first moving the U.S. cash offshore to China, then on to Mexico. Lim was a linchpin connecting both sides of the Pacific. In her November 2019 plea agreement, Lim admitted to laundering, with Gan and Pan Haiping, about $48 million in drug cash between 2016 and September 2017. She took a 0.5% commission, the agreement said.
	Lim testified at Gan's trial that she had two jobs. The first was collecting drug money in U.S. cities such as Chicago and New York from cartel contacts, typically anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million at a time. She would wait in a public place, armed with a burner phone, a code name and the serial number of an authentic $1 bill. Mexican cartels would pass on her details to their dealer contacts, who would call Lim's burner phone and use the code name to identify themselves. At the rendezvous point, Lim would give them the $1 bill with the corresponding serial number as a ""receipt"" to verify the handoff had taken place, Lim said at trial.
	Lim's other job was recruiting businesses in the Chinese diaspora to help them make that cash disappear, Lim and prosecutors said.
	Some U.S.-based Chinese merchants have long engaged in off-the-books currency ""swaps"" to avoid hefty bank fees. Such transactions are illegal in the United States, American authorities said, if they are used by companies routinely to skirt the formal banking system or to operate an unauthorized money transfer business. In some cases these informal, hawala-style transactions are used to help wealthy Chinese move money clandestinely out of China, in violation of that nation's currency controls.
	The operation run by Gan and Pan Haiping grew to include at least three Chinese merchants in New York, who were paid commissions to participate, Lim told the court. The names of the Chinese merchants were not revealed at Gan's trial, and it's unclear if they knew of Lim's links to drug trafficking.
	Prosecutors at trial presented testimony, evidence and graphics showing how the transactions worked. At their simplest, authorities said, that process worked as follows: Lim would arrive at one of the merchants with, say, $150,000 in cartel cash. With the businessperson observing, she would open a currency converter app on her smartphone to obtain the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan. She would also hand over the details of a bank account in China given to her by Gan. In what's known as a ""mirror transaction,"" the Chinese businessperson would take possession of the $150,000 in U.S. currency while simultaneously transferring the equivalent in Chinese yuan from their own account in China to the bank account number provided by Gan.
	The result was that a foreign transfer of funds had been made without involving a U.S financial institution - or the accompanying digital fingerprints. The Chinese business had effectively used yuan from its China-based bank account to purchase cash dollars now on hand in the United States; it earned a commission for its trouble while avoiding bank fees and U.S. government scrutiny.
	Meanwhile, Gan had converted U.S. drug dollars into Chinese currency now sitting in a Chinese bank. The only contact with the financial system – a domestic transfer between two accounts in China – would be unlikely to raise red flags with Chinese banking authorities unaware of the money's provenance.
	The crime ring used various Chinese banks for the operations, including the Bank of China, according to WhatsApp messages exchanged between Gan and Pan Haiping. The messages were extracted from Gan's iPhone by Homeland Security Investigations agents after his arrest, and key excerpts were read out aloud by prosecutors at trial, according to court transcripts.
	Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.
	To get the money from China to Mexico, Gan performed the same sort of mirror transactions, only this time with the help of Chinese businesses who had access to pesos in Mexico. This leg of the journey was described by the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and is outlined in court documents, including the U.S. government's September 2020 sentencing memorandum for Gan and the June 2019 superseding indictment detailing charges against him.
	U.S. prosecutors said the laundered money was delivered to Pan Haiping's Mexican drug cartel clients, according to the superseding indictment. No Mexican banks were named in any of the court documents reviewed by Reuters.
	In October, Reuters traveled to Guadalajara and found Gan's wife, Pan Emi (no relation to Pan Haiping), working in a busy store she owns in the city's Chinese quarter selling wigs, plastic jewelry, sunglasses and other low-cost merchandise imported from China.
	Manning the cash register, Pan Emi said her husband was innocent of wrongdoing and being unfairly portrayed by authorities as a criminal when he was nothing more than a plucky businessman. She said no Mexican or U.S. law enforcement agents had contacted her about the case.
	She said Gan, fed up with high Chinese taxes, had left his shoe factory in the Chinese city of Wenzhou nearly a decade ago seeking a better life in Mexico. In Guadalajara, she said, Gan co-founded a business exporting jellyfish, which are considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac in China. Pan Emi said her ""super friendly"" husband built a large network of friends and contacts in Mexico and was always on the phone.
	Pan Emi confirmed some details of the case. She said her husband knew Pan Haiping and Lim and had participated in currency swaps with other Chinese merchants. But she denied Gan was involved with traffickers or knew anything about drug money.
	She said currency swaps were common in the expatriate Chinese business community to avoid pricey fees and lousy exchange rates offered by banks.
	""These swaps that we do with each other are easy. It's no big problem,"" Pan Emi said. ""I don't think it's illegal.""
	Money brokers like Gan and Pan Haiping are growing in number among the large Chinese diasporas in the United States, Europe and Latin America, according to three DEA officials.
	Demand for their services is being driven by affluent Chinese looking to evade China's currency controls and move wealth abroad, the DEA officials told Reuters. Beijing limits the amount of money its citizens can transfer out of China to the equivalent of $50,000 U.S. dollars annually.
	Latin American cartels, flush with dollars and euros from drug sales, are uniquely placed to satisfy the Chinese appetite for hard currencies. Some Chinese expatriates located in drug-producing countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Peru are the intermediaries bridging these disparate sets of people, said Donald Im, a senior DEA agent and anti-money laundering specialist.
	""When there is need by the cartels for cash to be laundered, and there is demand for cash from the Chinese, you have a perfect marriage made in heaven,"" Im told Reuters. ""The Chinese brokers are very important to the Mexican and Colombian cartels.""
	In the case of Gan, it was a lucrative business, according to conversations between his alleged associates taped by Homeland Security Investigations agents. ""He has made $1 million already because of us, for real,"" Pan Haiping told Lim in August 2017, according to transcripts of intercepted phone communications presented at Gan's trial.
	Chinese money launderers are squeezing out Mexican and Colombian rivals by undercutting them on price by as much as half, U.S. officials said. The Chinese operators have been able to do that because they levy fees on both sides of each transaction. They impose fat commissions as high as 10% on Chinese citizens eager to get money out of China. That allows the Chinese money brokers, in turn, to charge traffickers nominal fees of just a few percentage points. The money launderers still turn a handsome profit while locking in a steady supply of coveted dollars and euros from cartel customers.
	DEA agent Im said the Chinese expats had the ""systems and the infrastructure"" in place not only to launder the drug proceeds but to do it so cheaply that drug cartels receive back ""almost 100%"" of their dirty money.
	Chinese money brokers have also managed to avoid choosing sides in Mexico's cartel wars, even coordinating money contracts with both the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels on the same day, according to a second senior DEA agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	Traffickers use other so-called trade-based money laundering schemes to move drug money from China to Mexico, according to the DEA and Mexican government officials who spoke with Reuters. In July, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit, an investigative agency, said publicly that Chinese nationals laundering money for the Jalisco New Generation cartel were using drug proceeds to buy shoes in bulk from China, then reselling them in Mexico to get the gang their cash.
	Chinese exports to Mexico, including electronics, clothing and other consumer goods, have nearly doubled over the past decade to $83 billion in 2019. The surge has allowed drug cartels and their money launderers to piggyback on this burgeoning trade relationship, authorities said.
	In Guadalajara, Pan Emi said e-mail exchanges with her husband's U.S. lawyers left her optimistic ahead of Gan's looming sentencing. Prosecutors have asked for a 20-year jail term; Gan's defense attorneys have argued for no more than two years.
	Pan Emi said business was going well in Mexico and she had no desire to return to China. ""I hope my husband comes back,"" she said."

	A subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma, according to a person familiar with a Justice Department tax investigation of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden's son.
	The breadth of the subpoena, issued Tuesday, underscores the wide-angle lens prosecutors are taking as they examine the younger Biden's finances and international business ventures.
	Hunter Biden's ties to Burisma in particular have long dogged the policy work and political aspirations of his father, Joe Biden, now the president-elect of the United States. It's unclear whether Hunter Biden's work at the Ukrainian company is a central part of the federal investigation or whether prosecutors are simply seeking information about all his sources of income in recent years.
	The person was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	A lawyer for the younger Biden, George Mesires, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment for this story and a spokesman for the Biden transition team declined to comment.
	Hunter Biden confirmed Wednesday that his taxes are under federal investigation. The revelation comes at a delicate time for the president-elect, who is building out his Cabinet and will soon decide on his nominee to run the Justice Department, the same department overseeing the investigation into his son.
	In addition to the Burisma-related request, the subpoena issued last week also seeks information on Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other financial transactions.
	The probe was launched in 2018, the year before his father announced his candidacy for president. At one point in the investigation, federal prosecutors were also examining potential money laundering offences, two people familiar with the matter told the AP.
	Hunter Biden said he only learned of the investigation on Tuesday.
	The younger Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then vice-president, was helping conduct the Obama administration's foreign policy with Ukraine. President Donald Trump and his allies have long argued, without evidence, that Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine influenced the Obama administration's policies toward the Eastern European nation.
	Senate Republicans said in a report earlier this year that the appointment may have posed a conflict of interest but did not provide evidence that any policies were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	The president-elect is not believed to be a focus of the investigation. He has not weighed in on the merits of the investigation, saying only to reporters on Friday that he was ""proud of my son.""
	For months, the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh has also been collecting information from Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and others as part of the Justice Department's process to receive and analyze information related to Ukraine, including documents Giuliani wanted to present to prosecutors that he had been gathering in Ukraine about Joe and Hunter Biden.
	In announcing that process in February, Barr cautioned that the department had to be careful about any information coming from Ukraine, saying: ""There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, a lot of cross currents. And we can't take anything we received from Ukraine at face value.""
	The former New York City mayor was a main character when the House voted to impeach Trump. The impeachment inquiry centred on Trump's dealings with Ukraine's president and whether he abused his office by seeking the investigation into the Bidens. Giuliani pressured officials to do the investigations and has been pushing unsubstantiated corruption allegations against the Bidens.
	Giuliani himself had also been under federal investigation, with federal prosecutors in Manhattan examining whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the matter. It was unclear whether that investigation remains active as Trump has discussed the possibility of preemptive pardons for some of his family members and close associates, including Giuliani."

	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.
	Pence also tweeted about Lai, saying the charges against him are ""an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere."""

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was “alarmed” that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the People’s Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canada’s arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	“Our government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,” said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	“It was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence … because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,” Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in “hostage diplomacy” and that the Chinese government back then “is completely different to the Chinese government today.”
	Conservative leader Erin O’Toole called the joint training exercise a “dangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.”
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	China’s President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending China’s interests.
	Meng’s arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department’s efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	“We will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,” Sajjan said.

              Diverse TV holiday season includes all-Asian Lifetime movie
          
","
              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”

                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/diverse-tv-holiday-season-includes-all-asian-lifetime-movie-1.5227204,"
	In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”
	Retorts Suzy: “I'm from Maine.”
	A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like “Chinese virus” and “kung flu.”
	“I think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,” Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. “I really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.”
	“A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.
	Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.
	“It was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,” Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and “full of Christmas heart.”
	Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).
	Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in “The Farewell” and “Mulan,” Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.
	“It was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,” Ma said in an email. “Lifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.”
	In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.
	“I think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,” Giroux says.
	Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.
	“I'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,” Giroux says. “That's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.”
	Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching “Crazy Rich Asians,” the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.
	“You hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,” Lai says. ”I am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.“
	The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.
	“I love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,” says Jennifer Liao, the director. “It's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.”
	“Sugar & Spice” is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's “Christmas Ever After.”
	Does Liao feel pressure as “the first” even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? “I feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,” Liao says.
	Lai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.
	“I think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,” Lai says. “We get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.”

	India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.
	Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the six-month standoff between the two countries' armies ""has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in the status along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.""
	Srivastava was responding to a statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in Beijing on Thursday that ""the rights and wrongs of what has happened in the China-India border area are very clear and the responsibility lies squarely with the Indian side.""
	Hua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. ""We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,"" she said.
	The standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.
	The countries have held a series of talks on ending the standoff without any breakthrough."

Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistant

	U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.
	Bloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.
	It quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau ""according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.""
	China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.
	Bloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.
	It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.
	""We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,"" a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
	Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.
	China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.
	China this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.
	Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials."

	China's sales of SUVs, minivans and sedans rose by double digits in November as the country recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, but were below pre-virus levels for the year, an industry group reported Friday.
	Sales in the industry's biggest global market rose 11.6% over a year earlier to 2.3 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 12.6% to 2.8 million, holding steady at October's growth rate.
	From January to November, passenger vehicle sales were off 7.6% from the same period of 2019, at 17.8 million. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 20.6% to 4.7 million.
	Full-year auto sales are on track to decline for a third year after hitting a peak in 2017.
	China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first country to reopen its economy after the disease was declared under control in March.
	November sales of all-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled, rising 104.9% over a year earlier. Sales in the first 11 months of 2020 edged back above pre-virus levels, rising 3.9% over a year earlier.
	Auto demand already was weak before China closed factories and dealerships in February to fight the coronavirus. Consumers are uneasy about slowing economic growth and a tariff war with Washington.
	That hurts global automakers that are looking to China to propel sales growth and are spending heavily to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet Chinese government sales quotas."

Chinese man extradited from Malaysia to U.S. over turtle-smuggling ring worth millions

A Chinese citizen who allegedly financed a turtle-trafficking ring has been extradited from Malaysia to the United States, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in a statement on Thursday.
	Kang Juntao, 24, from Hangzhou in eastern China, was initially charged with money laundering last February. Between June 2017 and December 2018, he allegedly financed a nationwide ring of people who purchased turtles in the U.S. belonging to five protected species, and arranged for them to be illegally shipped to Hong Kong.
	""The turtles were inhumanely bound with duct tape and placed in socks so as not to alert customs authorities,"" the DOJ statement said.
	According to Kang's indictment, at least 1,500 turtles -- with a total value of US$2,250,000 -- were smuggled out of the U.S.
	Using a PayPal account, Kang allegedly purchased turtles from sellers advertising on social media or reptile trade websites.
	These sellers allegedly shipped the turtles to ""middlemen"" who were ""typically Chinese citizens who entered the country on student visas,"" according to the DOJ. Kang allegedly paid and instructed them to repackage the turtles, and use false labels for shipment to Hong Kong.
	Once in Hong Kong, the turtles were allegedly sold on the black market for thousands of dollars each.
	Kang allegedly did not declare the turtles to U.S. or Chinese customs, or obtain required permits from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
	Authorities allege Kang trafficked the eastern box turtle, the Florida box turtle, the Gulf Coast box turtle, the spotted turtle, and the wood turtle -- all protected species under the CITES treaty.
	Kang was arrested at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport last January before his extradition to the U.S. on Thursday.

	Bahrain has announced plans to give the public free coronavirus vaccines, as Saudi Arabia said it approved an inoculation by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to fight the pandemic.
	The island nation of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, made the vaccine pledge in an announcement published late Thursday by its state-run Bahrain News Agency.
	""A safe vaccine will be provided free of charge to all citizens and residents within the kingdom,"" the statement said, without elaborating on which vaccine it would offer.
	Bahrain plans to inoculate everyone 18 years and older in the kingdom at 27 different medical facilities, hoping to be able to vaccinate 10,000 people a day. Bahrain, an island in the Persian Gulf home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, has a population of around 1.5 million people.
	A week ago, Bahrain said it had become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine after the United Kingdom.
	The Pfizer shots, a so-called ""mRNA vaccine,"" contain a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. To be vaccinated, a person receives two shots over 21 days.
	In the time since, Bahrain has not responded to questions from The Associated Press, including on Friday. Pfizer told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the ""timing of delivery and the volume of doses,"" were confidential and declined to comment.
	Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculated some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine is an ""inactivated"" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it.
	The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday described the Sinopharm vaccine as 86 per cent effective, but provided few details and answered no questions. It marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of that shot.
	Earlier Thursday, Saudi Arabia's Food and Drug Authority said it had registered the Pfizer vaccine ""so that health authorities in the kingdom can then import and use the vaccine.""
	The kingdom said it based its decision on information given by Pfizer on Nov. 24, without elaborating. Pfizer on Nov. 18 said its vaccine is 95 per cent effective.
	A major challenge for the Pfizer shot in the Mideast remains the weather, however. The vaccines must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
	Saudi Arabia said its Health Ministry later would announce plans on how it would distribute the vaccine in the kingdom, the biggest Gulf Arab state, with a population of 34 million people.
	Egypt received its first shipment of the Sinopharm vaccine on Thursday via the United Arab Emirates."

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's historically challenging transition to power is suddenly becoming even more complicated.
	A federal investigation into the finances of Biden's son Hunter threatens to embolden congressional Republicans, who have already shown little willingness to work with the incoming president or even acknowledge his clear victory in last month's election. For sure, it will complicate Senate confirmation hearings for Biden's yet-to-be-named attorney general, who could ultimately have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son.
	It all raises the prospect of even deeper dysfunction in a capital that is already struggling to address the nation's most pressing crises, including a surging pandemic whose daily death tolls are beginning to surpass the devastation of the Sept. 11 attacks. Republicans, particularly those eyeing presidential runs in 2024, are making clear they will press Biden on the issue.
	""Joe Biden needs to pledge today that he will co-operate with the federal investigation and answer any questions under oath,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Thursday, ""and that if he is sworn in as president, no federal investigator or attorney working on the Hunter Biden criminal case will be removed.""
	Hunter Biden has long been a source of worry for his father's campaign and was the subject of repeated unsupported accusations by President Donald Trump and his allies. But news of the probe, which was revealed on Wednesday and scrutinizes some of Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other transactions, caught most of his father's staffers by surprise.
	The president-elect had no public appearance Thursday as he moved forward with filling out his administration. But the investigation threatens to destabilize a transition that has prioritized a methodical rollout of Cabinet selections, White House hires and policy goals -- all meant to guarantee momentum when Biden takes office and immediately has to grapple with a surging pandemic and shaky economy.
	Most notably, the probe casts a spotlight on one of Biden's most important choices: his attorney general.
	Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland have emerged as the leading contenders, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press this week. But dynamics could shift, as any Biden choice now will be scrutinized for any perceived loyalty to the president-elect and bias in any probe of his son.
	Both Garland and especially Jones have longtime ties to Biden.
	The president-elect himself is not a subject of the investigation. And Biden aides believe that because other Hunter Biden stories have blown over, this will, too. They note that a tax fraud investigation pales in comparison to Trump's refusal to concede the election or to the pandemic that has killed more than 290,000 Americans.
	Biden is expected to announce more Cabinet picks, but not attorney general, on Friday.
	Trump's initial public response was surprisingly muted, just a pair of tweets about a Fox News segment on the story Wednesday night. But privately, he demanded to know why the investigation was not revealed ahead of Election Day, accusing officials of deliberately stalling in order to help Biden's chances, according to two Republicans familiar with the conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.
	Other Republicans, including possible presidential contenders, were anything but shy in piling on.
	""If there were ever circumstances that created a conflict of interest and called for a special counsel, I think those circumstances are present here,"" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Thursday. ""The Biden family has been trading on Joe Biden's public office for 50 years. Do we really think that that will change if Joe Biden becomes president, the highest office in the land?""
	Some of Trump's children have also faced some legal questions.
	Donald Trump Jr. was scrutinized in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe for the 2016 meeting he had with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. And Ivanka Trump was recently deposed by investigators from the District of Columbia attorney general's office as part of its lawsuit alleging the misuse of inaugural funds.
	The Hunter Biden investigation is the latest in a series of politically charged inquiries that the Justice Department has grappled with in the past five years, following probes into Hillary Clinton's email use and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
	Regardless of the facts of the investigation, a new Justice Department will likely feel compelled to assert its independence from the White House following allegations that its actions were overly politicized during the Trump administration. Biden has said he will play no role in department investigative decisions.
	""There are plenty of people that are going to have their hands in this one, but I think it's really going to be driven by the new administration's push to have total independence on any investigation,"" said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Weinstein, a New Jersey defence lawyer.
	""I think that's going to be paramount,"" he added. ""They are going to bend over backwards to make sure that they do the contrary to the current administration -- which is independence, let the investigation takes its course.""
	In this case, though, there is no perfect outcome for Biden.
	A protracted criminal investigation that results in an indictment would be a major distraction and then some as the new president tries to implement his agenda. But if the Justice Department decides against bringing charges, officials will feel pressure to explain their steps and reassure the American public the inquiry was done in a competent and thorough way.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including to Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe.
	The federal investigation, centring on potential tax crimes, had been going on at least a year before Biden announced his candidacy. Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to voting because of a department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts.
	Biden, fiercely protective of his own family, was said to be, in a statement released by his transition, ""deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	Biden struck a similarly defiant tone throughout the campaign whenever questions emerged about his son, which they frequently did. When Trump assailed Hunter Biden as a drug user during the first presidential debate in Cleveland, his father acknowledged that Hunter had had past substance abuse issues but added, ""He's worked on it. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.""
	The spotlight on Hunter Biden intensified in the election's final weeks, after Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed unsubstantiated claims about his foreign business dealings. Those were based in part on New York Post reporting on a laptop that supposedly once belonged to Hunter Biden and was abandoned at a Delaware repair shop.
	Hunter Biden had joined the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then the vice-president, was helping conduct Obama administration foreign policy with Ukraine. But, in a subsequent report, Senate Republicans did not produce any evidence that the hiring influenced U.S. policies.
	Joe Biden largely refused to even acknowledge the laptop controversy. His son, meanwhile, kept almost completely out of the public eye during the nearly 18 months his father was running for president.
	One of the few times he was seen was on stage outside the convention centre in Wilmington, Delaware, as his father was surrounded by joyous family members following his speech declaring victory in the presidential election. Hunter Biden, and his baby son, were right in the middle.

              'None of us imagined this': Michael Kovrig's wife marks two-year anniversary of his detention

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/none-of-us-imagined-this-michael-kovrig-s-wife-marks-two-year-anniversary-of-his-detention-1.5226164,"OTTAWA  -- 
	On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrig’s imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.
	""Here we are, two years later, still speaking about him being in detention. None of us would have imagined this was going to be the case,"" said Vina Nadjibulla in an interview on CTV’s Power Play on Thursday.
	""I hoped sincerely that Michael would be home by now and instead he’s facing a prospect of his third Christmas alone, in isolation, in detention.""
	Kovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested in China on Dec. 10, 2018, and charged with allegations of state spying for Canada. The Canadian government calls their detention arbitrary, while most in the diplomatic community view it as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days prior in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request.
	Consular access has been limited throughout the pandemic; the two men went 10 months without communication with Canadian representatives.
	""Our contact has been very limited between January and October. There were no consular visits, there were very few letters from Michael. Finally, in October we were able to get a consular visit and at least confirmation and a reassurance that he is still healthy and is doing well,"" said Nadjibulla, who is married to Kovrig but separated.
	Canada’s Ambassador to China Dominic Barton who is leading the effort to secure Kovrig and Spavor’s release, told a House of Commons committee this week that the two men looked ""robust"" and that one ""would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Nadjibulla called that long-awaited visit this fall a ""huge relief"" but notes she remains deeply concerned about his mental health.
	""Michael is doing everything he possibly can to keep his mind occupied with positive thoughts, with virtuous thoughts, with prayers of gratitude, with philosophical passages. Reading really provides him solace day-to-day, he essentially says that is what gets him through moment-to-moment, is being able to read and have access to books, which we’ve been advocating for quite a bit,"" said Nadjibulla.
	The Liberal government remains adamant it’s doing all it can to free the men, despite opposition criticism that Ottawa has been ""kowtowing"" to China over the last several years.
	""Today is the sad anniversary of the illegal abduction and imprisonment of two innocent Canadians in China,"" said Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole during a press conference on Thursday.
	""For months China has unfairly targeted our farming exports. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out mass internment of the Uighurs in concentration camps and still the Liberals keep pushing for more involvement and more engagement with China.""
	Optimism sparked last week when the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Justice Department was in talks with Meng’s legal team to resolve her fraud charges and allow her to return home should she admit to criminal wrongdoing. It led to speculation that the arrangement could pave a way for Kovrig and Spavor’s freedom.
	Nadjibulla says, more broadly, she was left hopeful after hearing that during the first call between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden the leaders discussed the fate of the two men.
	""I pray that we will be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.

              Politicians urge people to buy Australian wine in defiance of China

              Politicians from various Western countries have asked consumers to buy Australian wine in order to fight back against China's punitive tariffs on the beverage.

	Politicians from various Western countries have asked consumers to buy Australian wine in order to fight back against China's punitive tariffs on the beverage.
	China is the most important export market for Australian wine, and winemakers are scrambling to find new markets following Beijing's decision to slap tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine imports amid an escalating trade war between the two nations.
	Now a number of public figures associated with the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which calls itself ""an international cross-party group of legislators working to reform the approach of democratic countries to China,"" have called on consumers to stand up to Beijing.
	""We are asking you all to join us in standing against Xi Jinping's authoritarian bullying,"" said Miriam Lexmann, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) representing the Christian Democrats, in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday.
	""By drinking a bottle or two of Australian wine and letting the Chinese Communist Party know that we will not be bullied,"" added Elisabet Lann, a municipal councilor from Sweden's Christian Democrats.
	Other politicians featured in the video include Australian MP Kimberley Kitching, US Senator Ted Yoho and Shiori Yamao, an independent member of Japan's House of Representatives.
	Tony Battaglene, CEO of Australian Grape and Wine, a national association, said Beijing's tariffs have endangered business with mainland China.
	Battaglene works with around 800 wine producers in Australia who have ""built their businesses"" around exporting to China and are now left with no backup plan, he added.
	""We were surprised, we were shocked,"" Battaglene told CNN Business. ""Having the extent of these interim tariffs, I mean essentially they will close the market to Australian bottled wine, to premium wine, in China. There's no way that we can compete at those levels.""
	China's Commerce Ministry announced Friday that its decision was made after finding preliminary evidence of dumping. Australian officials have bitterly protested the move, saying that China has been unable to provide proof.
	The wine war is taking place against the backdrop of a wider deterioration in relations. Australia has upset China this year by calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing later targeted Canberra over trade, namely by suspending some imports of beef and slapping heavy tariffs on barley."

              'Two Michaels' mark two jailed years in China, no development in their cases

              Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng...

	In his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.
	As much as that matters, Kovrig's wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival.
	She says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.
	Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.
	Canada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they've endured their captivity was inspiring.
	""Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, and their families, have shown truly remarkable perseverance in the face of an unimaginable situation,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.
	Kovrig is ""marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength"" to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week.
	""He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,"" she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.
	""He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.""
	A statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.
	The statement said that ""contrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.""
	The statement also said that ""the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.""
	The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor's friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.
	Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada's diplomatic corps, a career-focused on preventing deadly conflicts.
	""He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,"" said Nadjibulla.
	She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy's ""War and Peace,"" to Nelson Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom."" He's reread one of his pre-prison favourites, ""Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.
	""It essentially posits that it's important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it's very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,"" she said.
	Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of ""fear into prudence, pain into information,"" said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added ""anger into determination and grievance into resolve"" to that philosophy.
	He has been drawn to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, ""which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,"" said Nadjibulla.
	Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.
	Robert Malley, Kovrig's boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They're also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.
	Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig's discipline.
	""None of us can be prepared for that, unless you're in the military and you're told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,"" said Malley.
	When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.
	Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton's on-site virtual visit in October -- his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn't allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.
	He was shocked at the pandemic's scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie ""Contagion.""
	Kovrig is also aware that he is one of ""two Michaels"" and understands that both he and Spavor ""are caught in this bigger situation,"" she said. It's not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.
	Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department's attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.
	If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.
	""Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,"" Nadjibulla said. ""They're pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.""

	China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	U.S. diplomatic passport holders visiting Hong Kong and nearby Macao will temporarily no longer receive visa-free entry privileges, spokesperson Hua Chunying said.
	U.S. administration officials, congressional staffers, employees of non-governmental organizations and their immediate family members will face ""reciprocal sanctions,"" Hua said.
	She was apparently referring to U.S. sanctions that bar certain Chinese and Hong Kong officials from travelling to the U.S. or having dealings with the U.S. financial system over their roles in imposing a sweeping National Security Law passed this summer that ushered in a crackdown on free speech and opposition political activity in Hong Kong.
	Hua said the move was taken ""given that the U.S. side is using the Hong Kong issue to seriously interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's core interests.""
	Those sanctioned ""have performed egregiously and are primarily responsible on the Hong Kong issue,"" she said at a daily briefing.
	""China once again urges the U.S. side to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and not go further down the wrong and dangerous path,"" Hua said.
	China had long threatened to retaliate against the U.S. sanctions and other actions seen as hostile.
	Earlier, China's official Xinhua News Agency said Trump administration officials are ""digging a hole"" for the next U.S. administration's relationship with China through actions targeting the country and its officials.
	Steps such as restricting visas for the 92 million members of the ruling Communist Party and their families have ""again exposed the sinister intentions of extreme anti-China forces in Washington to hijack China-U.S. relations for their own political gain,"" Xinhua said in an editorial.
	The U.S. State Department last week cut the duration of such visas from 10 years to one month, another example of the increasingly hard-line stance adopted by the administration in its waning days. That came in addition to the sanctions targeting specific Chinese and Hong Kong officials over their actions in Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has signalled he intends to keep pressure on China, he's also expected to seek a return to more conventional, less confrontational style of diplomacy. Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington's stance toward Beijing.
	""By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-U.S. relations on issues concerning China's core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration's relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains,"" Xinhua said.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.
	Dozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.
	On Wednesday, Pompeo accused U.S. universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was ""poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends.""
	Chinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying U.S. accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.
	Perhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.
	""Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation,"" Xinhua said. ""The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-U.S. relations."""

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/hunter-biden-tax-probe-examining-chinese-business-dealings-1.5224104,"WILMINGTON, DEL.  -- 
	The Justice Department's investigation scrutinizing Hunter Biden's taxes has been examining some of his Chinese business dealings, among other financial transactions, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	The investigation was launched in 2018, a year before his father, Joe Biden, announced his candidacy for president, but it isn't clear which entities might be tied up in the probe, and the inquiry was not disclosed to Hunter Biden until Tuesday.
	The younger Biden has a history of international affairs and business dealings in a number of countries, and the revelation of a federal investigation puts a renewed spotlight on the questions about his financial dealings that dogged his father's successful White House campaign.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including one for Hunter Biden, according to another person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe. The tax investigation centres on his business dealings, the person said.
	Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to the election because of a Justice Department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts, one of the people said.
	In a statement released by the president-elect's transition office, Hunter Biden said he learned about the investigation on Tuesday, but he did not disclose specifics about what was being scrutinized.
	""I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,"" he said in a statement.
	He has long been a target of President Donald Trump and his allies, who have accused him of profiting off his political connections. Trump and his supporters also raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption related to Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine at the time his father was vice-president and leading the Obama administration's dealings with the Eastern European nation.
	Late Wednesday, Trump tweeted a quote from New York Post columnist Miranda Devine claiming, ""10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.""
			“10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.” Miranda Devine @nypost @TuckerCarlson But I won anyway!
	The disclosure of the federal investigation, led by the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware, comes at an awkward moment for the incoming president, who is assembling his Cabinet. His pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son if it is still ongoing when Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.
	The transition team said in a statement, ""President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	It could also add weight to Trump's broad accusations that Biden was weak on China. Trump took a tough line on China during the campaign as he tried to deflect blame for the coronavirus. Biden has rejected the characterization that he was weak and said, that unlike Trump, he would rebuild global coalitions to check China's power.
	A New Yorker profile on Hunter Biden last year detailed some of his business work in China, including how he accompanied his father on a 2013 trip to Beijing, where he met with a business associate. He also acknowledged having received a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon involved in liquified natural gas projects. He downplayed the idea that the gift could have been intended to affect his father's policy. He told the magazine that he gave the diamond to an associate.
	""What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn't in office,"" he said.
	Hunter Biden has been caught up in controversies before. While his father was vice-president, Hunter joined the Naval Reserve and was discharged after testing positive for cocaine in his system, later revealing a yearslong struggle with addiction.
	He also joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, sparking concerns about the perceptions of a conflict of interest given the elder Biden was deeply involved in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. An investigation by the Republican-led Senate did not identify any policies that were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	In the weeks before the election, Trump supporters used the existence of a laptop they said was connected to Hunter Biden -- and the emergence of someone who maintains he had business discussions with him -- to raise questions about Joe Biden's knowledge of his son's activities in Ukraine and China. The president-elect has said he did not discuss his son's international business dealings with him and has denied having ever taken money from a foreign country.
	The laptop surfaced publicly in October when The New York Post reported on emails that it said had come from Hunter Biden's laptop and that it said it received from Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer.
	A third person familiar with the matter said the tax investigation does not have anything to do with the laptop. Like the other people who spoke to the AP, the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
	In a CNN interview last week, President-elect Biden addressed the business dealings of his son Hunter and his brothers, pledging that they would avoid any perceived conflicts of interest during his time in office.
	""My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict, where there's appropriate distance from the presidency and government,"" Biden said.

	The EU's medicines regulator said Wednesday it had been the victim of a cyberattack, just weeks before it is due to decide on special approval for two coronavirus vaccines.
	The Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the incident was being investigated but did not say exactly when it took place or give details about what was targeted.
	""EMA has been the subject of a cyberattack. The agency has swiftly launched a full investigation, in close cooperation with law enforcement and other relevant entities,"" the EMA said in a brief statement.
	""EMA cannot provide additional details whilst the investigation is ongoing. Further information will be made available in due course.""
	A spokeswoman for the agency referred back to the statement when asked for more details by AFP.
	The EMA has said it will give a decision on conditional approval for Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine at a meeting that will be held by December 29 at the latest.
	A ruling on Moderna's version should follow by January 12.
	The regulator is also carrying out reviews of vaccines developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine and Johnson & Johnson.
	The EMA moved to Amsterdam from London after Britain left the European Union in January 2019. It oversees all medicines for the 27-nation EU.
SERIES OF WARNINGS
	The cyberattack on the EMA comes after a series of warnings about hacking related to the coronavirus pandemic.
	Britain accused Russian-based, Kremlin-linked hackers in July of targeting labs conducting coronavirus vaccine research.
	Cybercriminals have tried to attack several pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca and South Korean laboratories, according to the Wall Street Journal.
	Spanish laboratories also reportedly have been attacked by Chinese cybercriminals, the El Pais newspaper reported in September.
	Microsoft urged a crackdown in November on cyberattacks perpetrated by states and ""malign actors"" after a spate of hacks disrupted healthcare organisations fighting the virus.
	IBM said last week that it too had uncovered a string of attacks, again potentially carried out by state actors, against companies involved in the effort to distribute the vaccine.
	The European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union was one target of the attacks, as well as European and Asian companies involved in the supply chain, IBM said.
	Meanwhile, it is not the first time a Netherlands-based international body has been targeted by hackers.
	Dutch authorities expelled four alleged Russian intelligence agents in 2018 after an alleged bid to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, using equipment in the back of a car parked in a neighbouring hotel."

              Why did Mount Everest's height change?
          
","
              China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.

	The world's highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story.
	China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.
	As definitive as that sounds, geological changes, the complicated business of measuring a mountain and varying criteria for determining the world's highest peak will likely ensure the question isn't settled for good.
	The mountain's height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down.
	The countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest's height earlier this year.
	""Nature tends to strike a balance,"" he told the official Xinhua News Agency. As an example, Dang cited a massive 1934 earthquake that wiped out 150 years of steady height increase in a few moments.
	There's more than one way to measure a mountain.
	Last year, a Nepalese team set up a satellite navigation marker on Everest's peak to gauge its exact position via GPS satellites. A Chinese team undertook a similar mission this spring, though it used the Chinese-made Beidou constellation of navigation satellites, along with other equipment.
	At the same time, Nepalese crews took measurements with modern, laser-equipped versions of instruments called theodolites, first used to gauge the mountain's height in 1856 by measuring angles using trigonometry.
	The Nepalese team also used ground penetrating radar to measure the amount of snow and ice that sits on top of its highest rock.
	China and Nepal jointly presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 metres (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The two had diverged for years over the mountain's actual height.
	The new height is 0.86 metres (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries' two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The agreement announced Tuesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between them.
	Measuring the height above sea level has always been tricky because ocean levels vary considerably depending on tides, magnetism and other factors. Rising sea levels are creating another factor for future measurements.
	How high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain's height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills.
	As measured from the Earth's core, Ecuador's Mount Chimborazo is the world's highest, standing more than 2,072 metres (6,800 feet) above Everest. Because the Earth bulges in the middle, mountains along the equator are farther from the core.
	Measuring from the foot of the mountain to the peak, Hawaii's Mauna Kea is the tallest. Most of it, however, is under the sea.
	This story has been corrected to say that the agreement was announced Tuesday, not Wednesday.

	Companies including the Chinese arm of TripAdvisor Inc. have been ordered by regulators to overhaul their mobile phone apps in what the Chinese government said is a crackdown on pornography and other improper content.
	The National Cyberspace Administration ordered the removal of 105 apps including TripAdvisor from app stores this week, although it gave no details of what each app was accused of doing wrong. It cited what it said were public complaints about obscene, pornographic and violent information or fraud, gambling and prostitution.
	The ruling Communist Party tightly controls what the Chinese public sees online and has launched repeated crackdowns on websites and apps.
	TripAdvisor China, a joint venture between TripAdvisor and its Chinese partner Trip.com, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
	Following the removal of its app in China, Nasdaq-listed TripAdvisor's stock price was down 1.68% to $29.59 at the market's close in the U.S. on Tuesday.
	TripAdvisor owns a 40% stake in TripAdvisor China, with Trip.com owning the other 60%. Under the partnership, the companies share its travel inventories and content.

              UAE says Chinese vaccine 86 per cent effective, offers few details

              The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.

	The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.
	The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.
	The UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.
	The UAE's Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they ""have reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""
	""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.
	It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.
	Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.
	The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.
	Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus' spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.
	Top officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.
	Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.
	In transport, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must remain at cold temperatures -- negative 70 degrees Celsius (negative 94 degree Fahrenheit) and negative 20 degrees Celsius (negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively.
	The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people in China had received its vaccine.
	Meanwhile Wednesday, Abu Dhabi announced it would resume ""all economic, tourism, cultural and entertainment activities in the emirate within two weeks."" It attributed the decision to ""successes"" in halting the spread of the coronavirus.
	Abu Dhabi has required those travelling into the emirate from the UAE's other six sheikhdoms to take a coronavirus test within 48 hours prior to arrival.
	Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over 9 million people.
	In Iran, meanwhile, President Hassan Rouhani angrily blamed U.S. sanctions for making it difficult for Tehran to purchase medicine and health supplies amid the pandemic.
	And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the first shipment of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, calling it a ""big day of celebration"" for the country.
	""I believe in this vaccine. I expect it will receive the appropriate approval in the coming days,"" Netanyahu said, adding that he intended to be the first to receive it. ""We see the end of the pandemic.""

	Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are physically and mentally well and showing inspiring resilience as they near the end of their second year of imprisonment by the People's Republic, says Canada's ambassador to China.
	Dominic Barton also says Chinese authorities were paranoid about containing the spread of COVID-19 as they denied consular access to the two men from January to October.
	""Our understanding of why it was the case is that the Chinese are completely paranoid about the virus,"" Barton said in testimony Tuesday night before the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations.
	Barton is leading Canada's efforts in China to win the release of Kovrig and Spavor, who were arrested and imprisoned on Dec. 10, 2018, in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou.
	After months of delay, Barton was most recently granted on-site virtual consular access to Kovrig and Spavor in November, following similar virtual visits with the two Canadians a month earlier.
	""We were obviously very frustrated at not being able to get access even virtually because as far as we know . . . the virus doesn't go through televisions,"" said Barton.
	The Chinese government has charged Kovrig and Spavor with espionage but the Canadian government says their detention is arbitrary and has called repeatedly for their release.
	Barton said it wasn't just Canada that was blocked by the Chinese from visiting prisoners charged in national security cases; the U.S. and Britain faced similar restrictions.
	When Barton was able to see them, he said he was able to verify they were in good physical and mental condition.
	""They are robust,"" said Barton, who was testifying from Beijing via video link. ""You would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Spavor is being held in a prison in the city of Dandong near the North Korean border while Kovrig is in a Beijing area prison.
	""It's a strange thing. We fly to these places, or drive to them in the case of Beijing. And I know that the Michaels (are) literally sort of on the other side of the wall, but you've got, you know, two big TVs,"" he said. ""It's like this.""
	Barton's main purpose for testifying was to describe the three-day Chinese government-controlled visit to Tibet that he and nine other Western diplomats undertook in October. He said he remains concerned about the human rights situation there and that they only saw what the Chinese wanted them to see.
	Even though the area is filled with security cameras, as is the capital of Beijing, Barton said he wandered off a couple of times to visit with locals without his Chinese government minders in tow.
	He said Canada is not reluctant to raise human rights concerns with China even though some people think Canada is in the Chinese ""doghouse"" these days. He also said that even though he knew the visit to Tibet would be controlled, it sent a signal to local people that the outside world still cared about their plight.
	Thursday marked Barton's second appearance before the committee this year, following testimony in February in which he declared ""the chill is real"" in Canadian relations with China.
	In February, Barton described an angry, emotional meeting during his first diplomatic contact with his Chinese counterparts after being appointed to the post in 2019 after a long career in business, which included being the global managing director of the consulting giant McKinsey & Co.
	His position in the company gave Barton high level access in China and across Asia, something the Trudeau government is hoping to leverage to win freedom for Kovrig and Spavor while maintaining economic relations with its second largest trading partner.

              Another judge blocks Trump's TikTok ban; app still in limbo

	A federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.
	The Trump administration had tried to ban the short-form video app from smartphone app stores in the U.S. and cut it off from vital technical services. TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.
	Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said in a ruling Monday that the Commerce Department ""likely overstepped"" its use of presidential emergency powers ""and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to consider obvious alternatives.""
	Nichols is the second federal judge to fully block the Trump administration's economic sanctions against the app as the court cases proceed.
	The Trump administration has alleged that TikTok is a security threat because the Chinese government could spy on app users' personal data. TikTok has denied it's a security threat but said it's still trying to work with the administration to resolve its concerns.
	Trump in September gave his tentative blessing to a proposal by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns by having the U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart invest in TikTok. Oracle would manage U.S. user data under the arrangement. But a federal agency still has to review and finalize an arrangement.
	A government deadline for ByteDance to complete the deal passed on Friday, and it's not clear what the status of the agreement is.
	The Treasury Department, which chairs the agency reviewing the deal, said Friday that the agency ""is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks arising from the transaction.""
	The Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, it's not clear what his administration will carry on the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to secure a ban, or increase the involvement of U.S. companies."

	A women's university soccer match in China descended into farce and was eventually called off after players were told that they were not allowed to have dyed hair, state media said Tuesday.
	The incident trended on the Twitter-like Weibo, angering many people, and comes after the men's national team were ordered to cover up their tattoos.
	The latest high-profile example of the shrinking space for individualism in communist-ruled China came when the women's sides of Fuzhou and Jimei universities met in a college league match in the southeastern province of Fujian.
	The teams were reportedly warned about the ban on dyed hair beforehand but as they were getting ready for the match on November 30 officials spotted that players from both sides had failed to heed the reminder.
	At least one Fuzhou University player was then spotted frantically having her hair dyed again in an attempt to return it to its original colour, but it failed to dry in time, the Beijing News said.
	The newspaper, citing someone at the scene who gave the pseudonym Zhang Zhi, said that some Fuzhou players also ran off to a nearby hair salon to buy black hair dye.
	However, one Fuzhou player was deemed ineligible because her hair was ""still not black enough"" so they were unable to field enough players, consequently forfeiting the match 3-0, the report said.
	Fuzhou University declined to comment when contacted by AFP. However, the China News cited the university as saying that the ban on dyed hair was ""in accordance with relevant regulations"" passed down from the education ministry in Beijing.
	""The relevant documents stipulate that players cannot dye their hair, have weird hairstyles or wear any accessories,"" the official said, adding it was a nationwide edict that had already been in place before the match.
	Many on Weibo were aghast at the ruling and the brouhaha trended on the social media network, racking up more than 400 million views.
	""I thought I was reading North Korean news,"" joked one user on Weibo.
	""Am I really living in the 21st Century?"" asked another.
	President Xi Jinping is a soccer fan and has grand plans to make China a leading country in the world's most popular sport.
	However, soccer has found itself in the crosshairs of the Communist Party's drive for a homogenized society.
	Players on the national team routinely cover their arms with long sleeves or bandages to hide their tattoos.
	Body ink is traditionally frowned upon in China but it is increasingly popular among young adults, even as authorities make plain their disdain for it."

	Shares in China's biggest online health care platform rose 50% in their Hong Kong stock market debut Tuesday, reflecting investor enthusiasm for the fledgling industry as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
	JD Health, an arm of JD.Com Inc., China's biggest online retailer, sells medications, hospital care packages and online consulting by doctors.
	Chinese internet companies increasingly offer health services in a society where hospitals are crowded and distribution of drugs and medical supplies outside major cities is uneven. Online consulting with Chinese-speaking physicians is popular with families from China who live in the West or other developing countries.
	Other competitors include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group's Alibaba Health; Baidu Health, run by search giant Baidu.com Inc.; and WeDoctor, run by Tencent Holding, operator of the popular WeChat messaging service.
	The coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for Chinese online platforms.
	Investors have ""high hopes for this kind of companies to develop in China,"" said Jackson Wong, asset management director for Amber Hill Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	The ruling Communist Party has encouraged growth of the industry by authorizing online pharmacies to deliver prescription drugs.
	During the pandemic, patients switched from going online only for urgent care to staying in touch with doctors about chronic conditions, according to industry analyst Kevin Chang of Bain & Co.
	""This new pattern of digital engagements is likely to continue and to increase the frequency of consultations,"" Chang said in a report.
	Consumer spending and business activity have rebounded to above pre-pandemic levels after China, where the pandemic began in December, declared the disease under control in March and eased most controls. Restrictions on travellers coming from abroad still are in place and visitors to public buildings are checked for fever.
	JD Health raised about $3.8 billion by selling 20% of the company to public shareholders.
	It was Hong Kong's second-biggest stock offering this year behind parent JD.Com, which has shares traded in New York and raised $4.5 billion in June when it joined the Hong Kong exchange.
	The ruling party is encouraging use of online health services to reduce the burden on hospitals.
	JD Health said it plans to expand its online pharmacy and develop ""smart healthcare solutions"" supported by artificial intelligence to work with physicians.
	The company says it had 72.5 million active users in June, up 30% over a year earlier.
	The industry might face tougher competition once the coronavirus is brought under control and patients have more offline options, said Wong.
	""If vaccines are very effective and people start going out again, the growth of these online service providers might not be as high,"" said Wong. ""That would be the biggest risk for this kind of company.""

	Hundreds of shoppers pack a wet market on a December weekday morning in the Chinese city of Wuhan, jostling to buy fresh vegetables and live fish, frogs and turtles.
	Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.
	""I'm not afraid, what is there to be afraid of?"" said Nie Guangzhen, a fish and vegetable vendor.
	Nie and other shop owners along a narrow street, part of the larger wet market, were busily gutting fish for streams of buyers - some not wearing masks - as city cleaners sprayed down the pavements.
	Few hints remain of Wuhan's early role in the coronavirus pandemic, which has since infected more than 67 million people globally, killing around 1.5 million people.
	China first alerted the World Health Organization to 27 cases of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan on Dec. 31. Authorities shut down a wet market in the city the next day, after discovering some patients were vendors or dealers.
	That marked the start of a dark period for the city of 11 million in central China. Infections spiraled quickly to 50,000 cases, including almost 4,000 deaths. Officials responded by swiftly imposing a tough 76-day lockdown, erecting kilometers of thick yellow barricades through the city's deserted streets to keep people at home and businesses closed.
	The measures paid off. Wuhan has not recorded a new locally transmitted case in several months and is now indistinguishable from other Chinese cities with crowded shopping streets, traffic jams and tightly packed restaurants.
	""I really missed these more fun and exciting times, like going out shopping and eating with my friends,"" said 27-year-old shopper Hu Hang on Monday at a packed Wuhan night market selling Christmas sweaters among other goods.
	In the busy street, hawkers sell flowers and balloons, street performers including dancers and a clown perform while music blares from shops lining the road.
	The city's recovery is a sharp contrast to other major economies heading into the Christmas and New year holiday season.
	In the United States, the health system is under severe pressure as cases mount and health officials warn the worst is yet to come. The country recorded 15,000 deaths over the past week, the deadliest seven days of the pandemic since April.
	Several European countries have rolled out tight restrictions on gatherings ahead of Christmas, fearing a return to peak levels of cases because of festive celebrations.
	China's relative success in controlling the virus has become a key talking point in Chinese state media.
	""I haven't been overseas, so I don't understand it well, but looking at the TV it seems like foreign countries don't put human life first,"" said Mr Li, a 54-year old Wuhan street food vendor, who reopened his shop in June. ""The ideology of foreign countries is not as good as that of China.""
	China has taken steps, including mass testing millions of residents following small-scale outbreaks, to prevent a second wave of infections seen in many other cities and countries.
	At the gates of residential compounds, staff in blue tents monitor residents' smartphone health codes. In a public park, slogans on red propaganda banners urge people to remain vigilant.
	Wearing face masks is not mandatory, but most people do so in public.
	And while shoppers have returned to Wuhan's streets, Li and others say business is yet to return fully to normal.
	""The whole situation is not great, it's still a lot worse compared to the last few years,"" Li said, referring to a slump in sales during the time after lockdown when people were too afraid to return to the streets.
	Still, for many residents, lockdown memories have been superseded by the city's swift reopening - alongside new precautions.
	""I don't worry, because I'm doing a good job of protection,"" said wet market vendor Nie, who said she will continue to disinfect and boil her clothes. ""Even if there is a second wave, I will just stick to it.”

              China, Nepal say Everest a bit higher than past measurements
          
","
              China and Nepal jointly announced a new official height for Mount Everest on Tuesday, ending a discrepancy between the two nations.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/china-nepal-say-everest-a-bit-higher-than-past-measurements-1.5221438,"KATHMANDU, NEPAL -- 
	China and Nepal jointly announced a new official height for Mount Everest on Tuesday, ending a discrepancy between the two nations.
	The new height of the world's highest peak is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 feet), which is slightly more than Nepal's previous measurement and about four meters (13 feet) higher than China's.
	Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Nepalese counterpart, Pradeep Gyawali, simultaneously pressed buttons during a virtual conference and the new height flashed on the screen.
	The height of Everest, which is on the border between China and Nepal, was agreed on after surveyors from Nepal scaled the peak in 2019 and a Chinese team did the same in 2020.
	There had been debate over the actual height of the peak and concern that it might have shrunk after a major earthquake in 2015. The quake killed 9,000 people, damaged about 1 million structures in Nepal and triggered an avalanche on Everest that killed 19 people at the base camp.
	There was no doubt that Everest would remain the highest peak because the second highest, Mount K2, is only 8,611 metres (28,244 feet) tall.
	Everest's height was first determined by a British team around 1856 as 8,842 metres (29,002) feet.
	But the most accepted height has been 8,848 metres (29,028 feet), which was determined by the Survey of India in 1954.
	In 1999, a National Geographic Society team using GPS technology came up with a height of 8,850 (29,035 feet). A Chinese team in 2005 said it was 8,844.43 metres (29,009 feet) because it did not include the snow cap.
	A Nepal government team of climbers and surveyors scaled Everest in May 2019 and installed GPS and satellite equipment to measure the peak and snow depth on the summit.
	Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Nepal later that year and the leaders of the two countries decided that they should agree on a height.
	A survey team from China then conducted measurements in the spring of 2020 while all other expeditions were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
	Nepal's climbing community welcomed the end of confusion over the mountain's height.
	""This is a milestone in mountaineering history which will finally end the debate over the height and now the world will have one number,"" said Santa Bir Lama, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.
	China's official Xinhua New Agency quoted Xi as saying the two sides are committed to jointly protecting the environment around Everest and co-operating in scientific research.
	For China, the announcement appeared to be as much about politics as geography. China has drawn Nepal ever closer into its orbit with investments in its economy and the building of highways, dams, airports and other infrastructure in the impoverished nation.
	That appears to serve China's interests in reducing the influence of rival India, with which it shares a disputed border, and Nepal's role as a destination for refugee Tibetans.
	The Xinhua report said nothing about the technical aspects but heavily emphasized the joint announcement's geopolitical weight.
	China and Nepal will establish an ""even closer community of a shared future to enrich the countries and their peoples,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying."

              China trade surplus hits record US$75 billion as November exports soar

	China's politically sensitive trade surplus soared to a record US$75.4 billion in November as exports surged 21.1% over a year earlier, propelled by American consumer demand.
	Exports to the United States rose 46% despite lingering tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington, customs data showed Monday.
	Total exports rose to $268 billion, accelerating from October's 11.4% growth. Imports gained 5% to $192.6 billion, up from the previous month's 4.7%.
	Chinese exporters have benefited from the economy's relatively early reopening after the Communist Party declared the coronavirus pandemic under control in March while foreign competitors still are hampered by anti-disease controls.
	“Exports were much stronger than expected in November,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.
	Forecasters say that surge is unlikely to last into 2021 once coronavirus vaccines are rolled out.
	“We expect export performance to be less impressive,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.
	China's global trade surplus for the first 11 months of 2020 is $460 billion, up 21.4% from this time last year, already one of the highest ever recorded.
	Exports to the United States rose to $51.9 billion while imports of American goods gained 33% to $14.6 billion. The trade surplus with the United States swelled 52% over a year earlier to $37.3 billion.
	Beijing promised to buy more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports as part of the “Phase 1” agreement signed in January and aimed at ending a costly tariff battle over Chinese technology ambitions. China fell behind on meeting those commitments earlier in the year but is catching up as demand rebounds.
	The two governments agreed to postpone further planned tariff hikes on each other's goods but most penalties already imposed on billions of dollars of imports stayed in place.
	Chinese imports are growing faster by volume than by value because demand has been chilled by the shutdown of travel and industry, driving prices lower.
	China is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan falls.
	China's economy shrank by 6.8% from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2% in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9% in the three months ending in September.
	Automakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other raw materials. Retail sales are back above pre-virus levels and rose 4.3% over a year earlier in October.
	Also in November, exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 8.6% over a year ago to $37.5 billion while imports of European goods gained 4.5% to $26.2 billion. China's trade surplus with Europe widened by 20% to $11.3 billion."

	Canada's main stock index moved to within two per cent of a record high Monday on gains in the materials and technology sectors.
	Gold and silver prices increased, partly on expectations that U.S. politicians will agree to additional fiscal stimulus, said Angelo Kourkafas, analyst on the investment strategy team at Edward Jones.
	In addition, there are renewed geopolitical concerns about ongoing Brexit negotiations ahead of Wednesday's deadline and the potential for new U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials over the crackdown on Hong Kong.
	The February gold contract was up US$26.00 at US$1,866.00 an ounce and the March copper contract was down 0.8 of a cent at almost US$3.52 a pound.
	Materials rose 2.1 per cent as shares of Oceanagold Corp. surged 31.9 per cent while Kinross Gold Corp. were up 7.5 per cent.
	The improved performance of Canada's technology sector and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite in the U.S. were attributable to worsening coronavirus trends and lockdowns on both sides of the border, Kourkafas said.
	""The focus and the market's attention ... is looking forward for the vaccine potential distribution. And that continues to be the main driver of sentiment,"" he said in an interview.
	Canadian and U.S health regulators are expected to soon grant emergency authorization for at least two vaccines presented by Pfizer and Moderna. A third vaccine has also been developed by AstraZeneca.
	Technology rose 1.3 per cent with shares of Shopify Inc. up 2.9 per cent.
	""We have seen this kind of tug-of-war between vaccine optimism and worsening coronavirus trends and clearly the focus now, especially in the U.S., is turning to the negotiations in Washington.""
	The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 61.38 points to 17,582.35. It hit an intraday high of 17,611.48 that is less than two per cent or 359 points below February's record high.
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 148.47 points at 30,069.79. The S&P 500 index was down 7.16 points at 3,691.96, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was up 55.72 points at 12,519.95.
	The Canadian dollar was unchanged from Friday at 78.12 cents US.
	The January crude contract was down 50 cents at US$45.76 per barrel and the January natural gas contract was down 16.9 cents at nearly US$2.41 per mmBTU.
	Lower prices pushed the energy sector down 0.9 per cent with Tourmaline Oil Corp. off 5.1 per cent. The price fall is attributable to concerns about demand as new restrictions in movement translates into lower demand for travel and a pullback after last week's strong oil price gains.
	""So we're seeing kind of that effect of the renewed restrictions show up in a little bit of a loss of momentum in the economic data. And we expect that to likely persist for the remainder of the year and likely the first quarter of next year,"" said Kourkafas.

	Chinese vaccine company Sinovac announced Monday that it is planning to complete a new facility to double its annual vaccine production capacity to 600 million doses by the end of the year, while also securing a US$500 million investment in a boost to its COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.
	The company is currently conducting the last stage of clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia and is among the frontrunners of China' s vaccine efforts. China has at least five COVID-19 vaccine candidates running late stage clinical trials across more than a dozen countries.
	Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd., a pharmaceutical conglomerate, bought a 15% stake in Sinovac for an investment of $500 million. The funds will allow the company to ""improve our vaccine sales capabilities, expand in Asia markets, develop and access new technologies, and most importantly, accelerate our efforts to help combat the global pandemic,"" Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong said in a statement.
	On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of its experimental vaccine arrived in Indonesia and are expected to be approved for use soon.
	Sinovac's candidate is a two-dose inactivated vaccine, an old-school technology in which a live virus is killed and then purified. It can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F), within the range of a normal refrigerator, unlike some other vaccines candidates that require far lower temperatures.
	Sinovac's experimental vaccine is currently approved for emergency use in China, although it has not yet obtained final market approval. Under emergency use, it has been distributed to groups the Chinese government deemed suitable, including front-line medical workers and border personnel.
	The latest public data from the company, published in the science journal Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who have recovered from COVID-19."

Chinese probe orbiting moon with Earth-bound samples
          
","
              A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.

	A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.
	The ascent module of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft transferred a container with 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of samples after docking with the robot spacecraft on Sunday and was then cut free.
	The orbiter and reentry vehicle will circle the moon for another week awaiting a narrow time window to make the roughly three-day, 383,000-kilometre (238,000-mile) journey back to Earth. It will first ""bounce"" off the Earth's atmosphere to slow its speed before the reentry vehicle separates and floats down on parachutes to land on the vast steppes of Inner Mongolia, where China's Shenzhou crewed spaceships have also made their landings.
	If the mission succeeds, it will make China the third country after the United States and former Soviet Union to bring moon rocks to Earth. They will be the first fresh samples of the lunar surface obtained by scientists since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 probe in 1976.
	The Chang'e 5 ascent stage blasted off from the moon's surface on Friday, leaving behind the lander module flying the Chinese flag, according to the China National Space Agency, which also released a photo taken by the orbiter showing it approaching for its rendezvous with the ascender, a sliver of the Earth seen in the background.
	That marked the first time China had succeeded in lifting off a spacecraft from a celestial body, while no country had previously achieved the tricky feat of executing a robotic docking in lunar orbit. Controllers on Earth had to deal with distance and time lag while precisely manoeuvring a clamp into position with almost no room for error.
	The 23-day mission has been front page news in state media for days, paired with reports that China has officially lifted all of its citizens out of the most grinding form of poverty. Along with being a propaganda coup for the ruling Communist Party, the dual stories illustrate the vast economic and technological advances China has made since it became just the third country in history to launch a person into space in 2003.
	Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying praised the ""courage to explore, overcome difficulties and pay hard efforts"" of those who made the mission possible.
	""The entirety of the Chinese people are proud of the efforts and wisdom of the Chinese lunar exploration researchers,"" Hua told reporters Monday at a daily briefing.
	By way of cautious incremental steps, China is now in the midst of a series of ambitious missions that include a probe en route to Mars and the development of a reusable space plane about which little information has been provided.
	The Chang'e lunar program, named after the ancient Chinese moon goddess, has also been operating the Chang'e 4 probe on the moon's less explored far side for the past two years, while the Chang'e 3 rover launched seven years ago continues to send back data.
	Future plans call for returning a human to the moon five decades after American astronauts, along with a possible permanent moon base, although no timeline has been offered. China is also building a permanent space station to begin operating as early as 2022.
	U.S. opposition has prevented China's secretive, military-backed program from participating in the International Space Station, although the CNSA has been expanding its ties with other programs, including the European Space Agency, which has helped guide Chang'e 5 on its mission.
	Chang'e 5 touched down Dec. 1 on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side close to a formation called the Mons Rumker, an area believed to have been the site of ancient volcanic activity.
	The rocks and other debris were obtained both by drilling into the moon's crust and by scooping directly off the surface. They are thought to possibly be billions of years younger than those brought back earlier and may offer insights into the moon's history as well as that of other bodies in our solar system.
	The lunar exploration program has set up dedicated labs to analyze the samples for age and composition. China is also expected to share some part of them with other countries, as was done with the hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of rocks, sand, dust and other samples obtained by the U.S. and the former Soviet Union."

              China prepares large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccines

              Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country's 1.4 billion people.

	Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country's 1.4 billion people.
	Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a UN meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.
	Even without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.
	China's fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.
	On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of the Chinese company Sinovac's vaccine arrived in Indonesia, the government said.
	""We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,"" President Joko Widodo said.
	Within China, so far only one developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine. Others have been approved for emergency use on people deemed at high risk of infection.
	""We must be prepared for large-scale production,"" Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
	Sun, who has as overseen much of the country's response, visited one of Sinopharm's Beijing subsidiary companies, Sinovac and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.
	The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month.
	The companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers.
	They say unlike Pfizer's vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.
	Health experts question why China is using experimental vaccines on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.
	Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.
	The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use.
	Authorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.
	The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).
	Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.
	In October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority.
	In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.
	In September, Sinovac's CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.
	Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.
	Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.
	Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.
	A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China.

              Negotiating contracts for vaccines in development needed flexibility: Anand

              Procurement Minister Anita Anand says that as soon as she knows when the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Canada, she will share that information with Canadians.

	Procurement Minister Anita Anand says that as soon as she knows when the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Canada, she will share that information with Canadians.
	But Anand told The Canadian Press in an interview this week that the original contracts to buy COVID-19 vaccines had to be vague about delivery dates because nobody knew at the time if the vaccines would be successful.
	It's only in the last few weeks, when the leading candidates from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca reported such positive results from their large clinical trials, that the way forward became clear enough for Anand's department to start asking the companies to be more specific about when they can make good on their contracts with Canada.
	""We put these contracts in place in order to place Canadians in the best stead possible, of any country in the world, recognizing that we would need to negotiate additional terms such as precise delivery dates, once a vaccine was discovered, and regulatory approval was obtained,"" she said. ""And that is what's happening now.""
	As Canadians face a pandemic-plagued holiday season and dream that 2021 will not be the anxiety-laden and often tragic disaster that 2020 has proven to be, there is one gleaming hope dangling still just out of reach: a vaccine for COVID-19.
	Still, the federal government has yet to answer one big question: When will it get here?
	It is not that she doesn't want to tell Canadians when, said Anand. But the complexities of figuring out a specific date are linked to when Health Canada approves the vaccine, and when the vaccine makers can see that Canada is ready to receive and safely distribute the precious doses, some of which have to be stored at temperatures below -70 C.
	Those pieces are starting to converge now.
	Health Canada officials are days, maybe even hours, away from approving the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech for use in Canada.
	Canadians got some more information on the logistics from a briefing of federal officials this week, including that Pfizer will ship its vaccine directly to 14 identified receiving sites in provinces. FedEx and Innomar Strategies were contracted Friday to oversee the delivery of other vaccines from a national receiving site to provinces.
	The National Advisory Committee on Immunization issued refined guidance Friday for who should get the vaccine first, including long-term care residents and workers, and people over the age of 80.
	The materials like syringes, gauze pads and bandages needed to vaccinate millions of people are in place. Ultralow temperature freezers have been purchased and nine new ones have already arrived. Provincial governments are lining up their own task forces.
	""We are going to have vaccines in this country, as expeditiously as possible,"" Anand said.
	Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole has been decrying the lack of clarity from the Liberals about the vaccine plan. A week ago he accused the Liberals of only starting to buy vaccines in a panic this summer after a collaboration with China on a vaccine fell apart.
	The partnership between the National Research Council and China's CanSino Biologics was announced in May to great fanfare. But the doses to be used in a Canadian clinical trial failed to arrive, when the Chinese government -- in the midst of political tensions with Canada -- refused to issue an export permit for them.
	""I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,"" O'Toole said Nov. 29, adding the timeline shows it wasn't until that deal fell apart that Canada ""started getting serious with Pfizer, Moderna, the other options.""
	Anand said that is not the case.
	She said the CanSino deal fell within Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains' portfolio, not her own, and nothing about the project prevented her from negotiating with other companies.
	Her marching orders to negotiate deals with other vaccine makers came weeks earlier. A team of procurement officials in her department was assigned to the file in March, at the same time as those negotiating contracts for medical supplies, personal protective equipment and rapid tests.
	In June, the COVID-19 vaccine task force provided a list of vaccines for Canada to pursue. Anand said talks with manufacturers began in early July. The first deal, with Massachusetts biotech firm Moderna, was struck July 24.
	Canada was first to sign with Moderna. It signed a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech a week later, on Aug. 1. It was the fourth country to do so, after the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan.
	News of trouble on the CanSino deal first appeared in early July when the doses still hadn't been approved for export by China. Canada walked away from the deal at the end of August when it became clear it would not happen.
	By then, Canada had deals with four other vaccine companies, including Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and NovaVax. It added deals with Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca in September and then with Canada's own Medicago the next month.
	Anand said Canada approached every contract with a similar goal -- to get 20 million doses guaranteed, and options to potentially buy more later on. In all, Canada is paying more than $1 billion to the seven vaccine makers for 194 million doses, even if those vaccines never get beyond the experimental stage.
	Another 220 million doses are available if Canada asks for them, a decision that will be made for the vaccines that are proving to be the best. Anand announced Friday another 20 million doses will come to Canada in 2021 from Moderna, for a total of 40 million.

              Bahrain now 2nd nation to grant Pfizer shot emergency use

	The island kingdom of Bahrain said Friday it has become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.
	The state-run Bahrain News Agency made the announcement on Friday night, following an earlier announcement by the United Kingdom on Wednesday, making Britain the first in the world.
	""The confirmation of approval by the National Health Regulatory Authority of the kingdom of Bahrain followed thorough analysis and review undertaken by the authority of all available data,"" the kingdom said on its state-run Bahrain News Agency.
	Bahrain did not say how may vaccines it has purchased, nor when vaccinations would begin. It did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	Pfizer later told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the ""timing of delivery and the volume of doses,"" was confidential and declined to comment.
	""We have developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support effective vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring, Pfizer said. ""Our distribution is built on a flexible just in time system which will ship the frozen vials to the point of vaccination.""
	The immediate challenge for Bahrain would be the conditions in which the vaccine must be kept. They must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit). Bahrain is a Mideast nation that regularly sees temperatures in the summer of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity.
	Bahrain does have a state-owned carrier, Gulf Air, that it could use to transport the vaccines. In the nearby United Arab Emirates, the Dubai-based long-haul carrier Emirates has already said it is preparing its facilities to distribute vaccines at ultra-cold temperatures.
	The vaccine also requires two doses be given three weeks apart.
	Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculate some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine, an ""inactivated"" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it, also is in use in the UAE.
	""The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to the kingdom's national COVID-19 response, which has strongly prioritized protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic,"" said Dr. Mariam al-Jalahma, the CEO of Bahrain's National Health Regulatory Authority.
	BioNTech, which owns the vaccine, said it has so far signed deals to supply 570 million doses worldwide in 2021, with options to deliver 600 million more. It hopes to supply at least 1.3 billion in 2021.
	Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is a small island off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf.
	With a population of 1.6 million, it has reported more than 87,000 cases and 341 deaths, according to the government. Over 85,000 people have recovered from the COVID-19 illness that is caused by the virus.
	The country is also home to a large expatriate population, with many low-paid labourers from southeast Asia living in tight housing. In July, authorities told the AP they had moved 8,000 labourers to new accommodations, disinfected housing and implemented a rule requiring no more than five labourers per room, with about 3 metres (10 feet) of space for each one.
	The Bahraini government says it has conducted over 2 million coronavirus tests across the island. It initially blamed its higher per-capita infection rate on that."

	The top U.S. intelligence official stepped up the Trump administration's harsh attacks on Beijing on Thursday, labelling China the biggest threat to democracy and freedom worldwide since the Second World War and saying it was bent on global domination.
	""The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,"" Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said in an opinion article on the Wall Street Journal website.
	Ratcliffe, a former Republican congressman appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump to the top U.S. spy job last spring, said China posed ""the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War Two.""
	He said he had shifted resources within the US$85 billion annual federal budget allocated to intelligence to increase the focus on China.
	Ratcliffe said China's economic espionage approach was threefold: ""Rob, Replicate and Replace.""
	He said the strategy was for Chinese entities to steal American companies' intellectual property, copy it and then supplant U.S. companies in the global market place.
	A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy rejected Ratcliffe's comments as ""fact-distorting"" and hypocritical and said they showed ""the entrenched Cold-War mindset and ideological prejudices of some people on the U.S. side.""
	Beijing has frequently called on U.S. leaders to dial back their rhetoric on China, which it blames on fear of China's growing role in the world.
	Ratcliffe's essay was the latest broadside against China from Trump's administration as it seeks to cement the outgoing president's tough-on-China legacy following his Nov. 3 election defeat.
	Trump's approach has taken relations between the world's two largest economies to their lowest point in decades and analysts say it could limit the incoming Biden administration's room for manoeuvre in dealing with Beijing.
	Ratcliffe alluded to reports collected by U.S. intelligence agencies that Chinese representatives have sought to interfere in U.S. domestic politics.
	He also charged that China had stolen U.S. defense technology to fuel President Xi Jinping's aggressive military modernization plans.
	""The election is over. Now let’s all be honest about China,"" Ratcliffe told Reuters after the article was published.
	Among other issues, Washington and Beijing have clashed over China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, its tightening grip on Hong Kong, its disputed claims in the South China Sea, trade and accusations of human rights crimes in Xinjiang.
	Ratcliffe, who served only briefly on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee before Trump appointed him to his role, has been accused by Democrats and current and former intelligence officials of politicizing intelligence.
	In his essay, Ratcliffe said Chinese authorities had ""conducted human testing"" on members of the Chinese army ""in hopes of developing soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities."" He did not elaborate.
	U.S.-based think tanks have reported that China is giving increasing importance to biotechnology in its military strategy but they have not released detailed reports about the kind of testing alleged by Ratcliffe.
	On Thursday, the Trump administration restricted travel to the United States by members of China's ruling Communist Party and their families.
	On Wednesday, it banned cotton imports from a quasi-military organization in Xinjiang it says uses forced labor of detained Muslims, while the House passed a law to kick Chinese firms off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not comply with auditing rules.
	China accused U.S. politicians of fabricating news of detained Muslims being forced into labor in Xinjiang.
	In an emailed statement, the embassy spokesperson said ""no one deserves the title of Empire of Hacking and Spying better than the U.S."" and charged that both the U.S. government and U.S. firms had long carried out ""large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber theft, surveillance and attack.""
	Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said Ratcliffe's comments appeared aimed at locking in a tough approach before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
	""It does appear to part of a broader effort to tie Biden's hands and limit his room to maneuver on China policy,"" she said.
	""In prior administrations, the norm has been to avoid taking such actions during a presidential transition, but the Trump administration has long set a pattern of bucking the norm."" "

              Astronauts harvest radishes grown aboard the International Space Station

              Astronauts are harvesting fresh radishes grown in space, a delicious prospect that also could help seed food production efforts for longer-term missions to the moon and Mars.

	Astronauts are harvesting fresh radishes grown in space, a delicious prospect that also could help seed food production efforts for longer-term missions to the moon and Mars.
	On Monday, NASA flight engineer Kate Rubins pulled out 20 radish plants grown in the space station's Advanced Plant Habitat, wrapping them in foil for cold storage until they can make the voyage back to Earth next year.
	Radishes are the latest type of fresh produce to be successfully grown and harvested in zero gravity, joining ""Outredgeous"" red romaine lettuce, green lettuce, Chinese cabbage, lentils and mustard, according to a NASA fact sheet.
	""I've worked on APH since the beginning, and each new crop that we're able to grow brings me great joy because what we learn from them will help NASA send astronauts to Mars and bring them back safely,"" said Nicole Dufour, the Advanced Plant Habitat program manager at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, in a news release.
	Back on the ground, scientists at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida are growing radishes in a control group set for harvest on December 15. The researchers will compare the space-grown radishes to the veggies grown on Earth, checking on how space produce measures up on providing the minerals and nutrients astronauts need as they prepare for longer trips.
	Meanwhile, astronauts will repeat the radish experiment in the heavens, planting and harvesting another round of radish crop to give scientists more data to draw from.
	With their short cultivation time, radishes present potential advantages as a food source for future astronauts embarking on deep space missions in years to come. The radishes grow quickly, and they can reach full maturity in 27 days.
	The root vegetables also don't require much maintenance from the crew as they grow.
	""Radishes provide great research possibilities by virtue of their sensitive bulb formation,"" said Karl Hasenstein, a professor of biology at the University of Louisiana and the principal investigator on the project, in a news release.
	Researchers will analyze the effects of carbon dioxide on the radishes as well as how the vegetables acquire and distribute minerals, according to Hasenstein, who has run plant experiments with NASA since 1995.
	Astronauts have grown 15 different types of plants on the station, including eight different types of leafy greens. And NASA has already tested more than 100 crops on Earth, identifying which candidates to try out next in space.
	""Growing a range of crops helps us determine which plants thrive in microgravity and offer the best variety and nutritional balance for astronauts on long-duration missions,"" Dufour said.
	The latest experiments build upon ongoing research growing and harvesting plants in space.
	Researchers at NASA began experiments using its Vegetable Production Systems growth chambers back in 2014 shortly after they were delivered to the space station.
	Some of the early experiments with red romaine lettuce resulted in a paper, published this March in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science, showing that space lettuce was safe to eat.
	In August 2015, NASA shared a video that features American astronauts Dr. Kjell Lindgren and Scott Kelly floating aboard the station, saying ""Cheers"" and eating the space-grown treat.
	""Tastes good,"" Kelly said.
	Lindgren tweeted about how he put his lettuce into a space cheeseburger for dinner.
	Getting space agriculture right matters because the nutrients in the prepackaged food that astronauts currently eat in space degrade over a period of time, NASA said.
	Getting humans to Mars and back safely over a two- or three-year mission requires growing food along the way. That not only gives astronauts more of a vibrant supply of fresh nutrients on the voyage; it also serves an emotional need as they tend to crops that are both a figurative and literal taste of home, according to the agency.
	The NASA Artemis program aims to land the first woman and next man on the moon in 2024, and to establish a sustained presence on the moon by 2028. From there, the agency will be poised to begin staging its next big leap, to Mars.
	But before we make it to the red planet, we've first got to make a tasty green space salad."

	China's senior diplomat in Australia said Prime Minister Scott Morrison overreacted to a social media post about alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, adding that his actions drew more attention to the report.
	Earlier this week, Morrison said that a Chinese official's tweet showing the fake image of an Australian soldier appearing to slit a child's throat was ""truly repugnant"" and merits an apology, which has not come from China.
	""I think it's unfortunate that this issue evolved in such a way that has gone astray and now there is a much larger visibility of the Brereton report in China,"" China's deputy ambassador, Wang Xining, said Friday. ""More people are attentive to what happened in Afghanistan. People wonder why a national leader would have such a strong opinion to an artwork done by a normal young artist in China.""
	He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month that found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the conflict in Afghanistan. It recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.
	It followed a four-year investigation by Maj. Gen. Paul Brereton, a judge and army reservist who was asked to look into the allegations and interviewed more than 400 witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.
	Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, posted the graphic image that shows a grinning soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of a veiled child, who is holding a lamb.
	Zhao wrote a caption with the tweet saying: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.""
	Many of Australia's allies have been critical of the tweet, with the European Union calling it ""irresponsible.""
	""We consider the deliberate dissemination of a fabricated image via social media accounts affiliated with China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be irresponsible, insensitive, and not at all constructive, particularly given the subject in question,"" said an EU spokesman.
	""Such behaviour and use of information tools to disseminate fabricated images or information cannot be justified.""
	Officials from the United States, New Zealand and Canada have also criticized the Chinese tweet.
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports, most recently to its lucrative wine industry."

	The U.S. government has stepped up a feud with Beijing over security by adding China's biggest processor chip maker and a state-owned oil giant to a blacklist that limits access to American technology and investment.
	Thursday's announcement adds to steps taken by U.S. President Donald Trump against China since losing his re-election bid Nov. 3. Political analysts have said Trump was likely to take further action before President-elect Joe Biden takes office Jan. 20.
	The Pentagon added four companies including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. to a list of entities deemed to be part of efforts to modernize the ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army. That raises the total number of companies on the blacklist to 35.
	SMIC plays a leading role in the ruling party's effort to reduce reliance on U.S. and other foreign technology by creating Chinese suppliers of processor chips and other components.
	China's government has criticized such restrictions as an abuse of national security arguments to handicap fledgling Chinese competitors in technology and other fields.
	That has taken on greater urgency after Washington blocked access to American chips and other technology for telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. and imposed curbs on other Chinese buyers. The White House also has blocked the use of U.S. technology by global vendors to produce chips for Huawei.
	CNOOC is the smallest of China's three main state-owned oil producers.
	Political analysts expect little change in policy under Biden due to widespread frustration with China's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.
	The 2.3 million-member PLA is one of the world's biggest and best-armed militaries. It is spending heavily to develop nuclear submarines, stealth fighters, ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons.
	The Pentagon's first list of 20 companies deemed to be PLA-linked in June included Huawei and video surveillance provider HikVision Digital Technology Co. Both say they never have taken part in military-related research.
	Also cited by the Pentagon in earlier lists are state-owned phone carriers China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Ltd. and petrochemical, construction, aerospace, rocketry, shipbuilding and nuclear power equipment companies."

	A Chinese spacecraft lifted off from the moon Thursday night with a load of lunar rocks, the first stage of its return to Earth, the government space agency reported.
	Chang'e 5, the third Chinese spacecraft to land on the moon and the first to take off from it again, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a orbiter and rover headed to Mars.
	The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side. Its mission: collect about 2 kilograms (4 pounds) of lunar rocks and bring them back to Earth, the first return of samples since Soviet spacecraft did so in the 1970s. Earlier, the U.S. Apollo astronauts brought back hundreds of pounds of moon rocks.
	The landing site is near a formation called the Mons Rumker and may contain rocks billions of years younger than those retrieved earlier.
	The ascent vehicle lifted off from the moon shortly after 11 p.m. Beijing time Thursday (1500 GMT) and was due to rendezvous with a return vehicle in lunar orbit, then transfer the samples to a capsule, according to the China National Space Administration. The moon rocks and debris were sealed inside a special canister to avoid contamination.
	It wasn't clear when the linkup would occur. After the transfer, the ascent module would be ejected and the capsule would remain in lunar orbit for about a week, awaiting the optimal time to make the trip back to Earth.
	Chinese officials have said the capsule with the samples is due to land on Earth around the middle of the month. Touchdown is planned for the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's astronauts have made their return in Shenzhou spacecraft.
	Chang'e 5's lander, which remained on the moon, was capable of scooping samples from the surface and drilling 2 metres (about 6 feet).
	While retrieving samples was its main task, the lander also was equipped to extensively photograph the area, map conditions below the surface with ground penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.
	Right before the ascent vehicle lifted off, the lander unfurled what the space administration called the first free-standing Chinese flag on the moon. The agency posted an image -- apparently taken from the lander -- of the ascend vehicle firing its engines as it took off.
	Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending astronauts to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.
	China launched its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.
	While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by U.S. concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program."

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/burner-phones-and-banking-apps-meet-the-chinese-brokers-laundering-mexican-drug-money-1.5215195,"GUADALAJARA -- 
	Early next year, a Chinese businessman named Gan Xianbing will be sentenced in a Chicago courtroom for laundering just over US$530,000 in Mexican cartel drug money.
	Gan, 50, was convicted in February of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transfer business that whisked cartel cash from U.S. drug sales offshore. Gan has maintained his innocence; his lawyers say he was entrapped by U.S. authorities. The trial garnered few headlines and little of the public fascination reserved for kingpins of powerful narcotics syndicates that U.S. federal prosecutors said Gan served.
	Still, U.S. law enforcement officials told Reuters that Chinese ""money brokers"" such as Gan represent one of the most worrisome new threats in their war on drugs. They say small cells of Chinese criminals have upended the way narcotics cash is laundered and are displacing the Mexican and Colombian money men that have long dominated the trade.
	Virtually unheard of a decade ago, these Chinese players are moving vast sums quickly and quietly, authorities said. Their expertise: routing cartel drug profits from the United States to China then on to Mexico with a few clicks of a burner phone and Chinese banking apps – and without the bulky cash ever crossing borders. The launderers pay small Chinese-owned businesses in the United States and Mexico to help them move the funds. Most contact with the banking system happens in China, a veritable black hole for U.S. and Mexican authorities.
	Chinese money brokers based in Mexico ""have come to dominate international money laundering markets,"" U.S. prosecutors said in a Sept. 24 sentencing memorandum for Gan's case.
	Reuters spoke to more than a dozen law enforcement officials, diplomats, lawyers and sources familiar with the Gan case or Chinese money laundering techniques. The news organization also examined more than 1,500 pages of documents from the trial. The material included previously unreported details about how the ring operated compiled by prosecutors and agents of Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that led the probe.
	What emerged was a blueprint showing how some groups of Chinese money brokers have become key cogs in the multi-billion-dollar drug empires run by Latin American cartels. The Chinese role presents a formidable challenge for U.S. anti-narcotics efforts at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.
	Gan, who U.S. prosecutors said operated a tight ring with another Chinese money broker, was apprehended in November 2018 by Homeland Security Investigations agents at Los Angeles International Airport on his way to Mexico from Hong Kong. The U.S. government said that Gan had moved anywhere from $25 million to $65 million in illicit drug proceeds from 2016 to the time of his arrest, according to a September court filing by Gan's attorneys.
	Based in Guadalajara, the ring is believed to have worked with multiple syndicates, including the famed Sinaloa Cartel that was previously led by jailed Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to two U.S.-based sources familiar with the investigation.
	The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Europol, the European Union's law enforcement arm, have warned about the expanding web of Chinese crime groups laundering drug money. Europol in November 2019 said these groups present a ""growing threat to Europe,"" while the U.S. Treasury in February placed Chinese professional money laundering networks on its list of ""key threats"" and vulnerabilities within the U.S. financial system.
	U.S. law enforcement has stepped up operations against these groups. In addition to the Gan case in Illinois, federal prosecutors have brought charges in Virginia and Oregon against alleged members of at least two other Chinese money laundering rings since October of last year. Those cases are pending.
	Still, a senior U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent said U.S. efforts to nail Latin American drug capos by following the money have gotten much more difficult.
	""I can't emphasize this enough, the involvement of the Chinese has really complicated all of these schemes,"" the DEA official said.
	Gan, who declined to testify in court, pleaded not guilty to three counts of money laundering, one count of conspiracy to launder money and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was acquitted on the conspiracy charge. Reuters did not receive a reply to requests for comment from Gan sent to his legal team.
	His lawyers, in a September sentencing plea document, said Gan was not the mastermind of the operation, rather a seafood exporter who was duped into letting his bank account in China be used to launder money by another Mexico-based Chinese national named Pan Haiping. Glenn Seiden, Gan's lawyer, declined to speak with Reuters or answer questions about Gan's case.
	Attorney Aaron Schwartz, who was part of the defense team, said he wanted to make it clear that Gan did not cooperate with the U.S. government because his client feared for the safety of his family in Guadalajara, where the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel holds sway. Gan's lawyers also allege Gan was entrapped in a sting operation by Homeland Security Investigations agents working with an informant who helped arrange the transactions that resulted in their client's conviction. The agency said it does not comment on ongoing investigations.
	Pan Haiping, Gan's alleged associate, was detained earlier this year in Mexico on accusations of money laundering and is awaiting extradition to the United States, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and a senior Mexican federal police source. Pan Haiping could not be reached for comment. The Mexican prosecutor's office declined to comment on Pan Haiping's case or provide the name of his legal counsel in Mexico, saying it cannot comment on ongoing cases.
	In a March 2019 U.S. indictment unsealed a few weeks ago, Pan Haiping was charged with laundering almost $500,000 for Mexican cartels; running an illegal money transmitting business in Illinois; and conspiring to launder money using bank accounts in China, including an account belonging to Gan.
	Another alleged conspirator, Long Huanxin, was arrested in February at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian law enforcement acting on a warrant from U.S. authorities, according to Canadian court transcripts from Long's detention hearing. Long was extradited to the United States, and last month he pleaded not guilty in Chicago to charges of money laundering for Mexican cartels, U.S. court documents show. Long's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
	U.S officials informally sought assistance from China in the Gan case but received no support in their investigation, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the probe.
	China's Foreign Ministry disputed their account. The ministry told Reuters in late October that it did not receive a request from U.S. authorities for help on that case. China stands ready to cooperate with the United States to ""destroy drug cartels and drug-related money-laundering networks,"" the ministry said in a statement. But it stressed the need for the two countries to work on the ""principle of respecting each other's laws, equality and mutual benefit,"" the statement said.
	The ministry said most Chinese bank-account holders about whom Washington has inquired as part of its money laundering investigations in recent years were ""legitimate enterprises and individuals"" in China. ""After we asked the U.S. side to provide drug-related clues or evidence of enterprises and individuals, the U.S. side has not responded,"" China's Foreign Ministry said in the statement.
	Without help from Beijing to track money flows in China and to infiltrate the laundering networks, U.S. agents say they face an uphill struggle to catch culprits.
	""It's the most sophisticated form of money laundering that's ever existed,"" one of the U.S. sources familiar with the investigation said.
	Key to cracking the case was Lim Seok Pheng, a New York-based member of the ring who became a cooperating witness for the U.S. government following her May 2018 arrest on suspicion of money laundering.
	A Singapore national, Lim said at Gan's trial that she once peddled footwear and had first met Gan in China where he ran a shoe factory before he relocated to Guadalajara in 2011. Lim testified that Gan recruited her to join the illicit operation in 2016 and that she became lovers with the other alleged ringleader, Pan Haiping.
	Following her arrest at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, Lim agreed to wear a recording device to help authorities gather evidence against Gan and the other alleged conspirators. She also brought undercover Homeland Security Investigations agents into the operation as money couriers on three separate cash pick-ups in Chicago that led to Gan's conviction, according to the trial testimony of Lim and the agents.
	Lim pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in November 2019 and is out on bail, awaiting sentencing.
	She and her attorney declined to comment.
	The only thing tougher than moving illegal drugs across borders is getting the profits back to Mexico's cartels, U.S. officials said. Cash is heavy, and transporting it exposes traffickers to lots of risk. Putting it into the banking system is perilous, too. The U.S. and Mexican financial systems have been geared to detect dirty money.
	Prosecutors told the court that Gan and his accomplices sidestepped these obstacles by first moving the U.S. cash offshore to China, then on to Mexico. Lim was a linchpin connecting both sides of the Pacific. In her November 2019 plea agreement, Lim admitted to laundering, with Gan and Pan Haiping, about $48 million in drug cash between 2016 and September 2017. She took a 0.5% commission, the agreement said.
	Lim testified at Gan's trial that she had two jobs. The first was collecting drug money in U.S. cities such as Chicago and New York from cartel contacts, typically anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million at a time. She would wait in a public place, armed with a burner phone, a code name and the serial number of an authentic $1 bill. Mexican cartels would pass on her details to their dealer contacts, who would call Lim's burner phone and use the code name to identify themselves. At the rendezvous point, Lim would give them the $1 bill with the corresponding serial number as a ""receipt"" to verify the handoff had taken place, Lim said at trial.
	Lim's other job was recruiting businesses in the Chinese diaspora to help them make that cash disappear, Lim and prosecutors said.
	Some U.S.-based Chinese merchants have long engaged in off-the-books currency ""swaps"" to avoid hefty bank fees. Such transactions are illegal in the United States, American authorities said, if they are used by companies routinely to skirt the formal banking system or to operate an unauthorized money transfer business. In some cases these informal, hawala-style transactions are used to help wealthy Chinese move money clandestinely out of China, in violation of that nation's currency controls.
	The operation run by Gan and Pan Haiping grew to include at least three Chinese merchants in New York, who were paid commissions to participate, Lim told the court. The names of the Chinese merchants were not revealed at Gan's trial, and it's unclear if they knew of Lim's links to drug trafficking.
	Prosecutors at trial presented testimony, evidence and graphics showing how the transactions worked. At their simplest, authorities said, that process worked as follows: Lim would arrive at one of the merchants with, say, $150,000 in cartel cash. With the businessperson observing, she would open a currency converter app on her smartphone to obtain the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan. She would also hand over the details of a bank account in China given to her by Gan. In what's known as a ""mirror transaction,"" the Chinese businessperson would take possession of the $150,000 in U.S. currency while simultaneously transferring the equivalent in Chinese yuan from their own account in China to the bank account number provided by Gan.
	The result was that a foreign transfer of funds had been made without involving a U.S financial institution - or the accompanying digital fingerprints. The Chinese business had effectively used yuan from its China-based bank account to purchase cash dollars now on hand in the United States; it earned a commission for its trouble while avoiding bank fees and U.S. government scrutiny.
	Meanwhile, Gan had converted U.S. drug dollars into Chinese currency now sitting in a Chinese bank. The only contact with the financial system – a domestic transfer between two accounts in China – would be unlikely to raise red flags with Chinese banking authorities unaware of the money's provenance.
	The crime ring used various Chinese banks for the operations, including the Bank of China, according to WhatsApp messages exchanged between Gan and Pan Haiping. The messages were extracted from Gan's iPhone by Homeland Security Investigations agents after his arrest, and key excerpts were read out aloud by prosecutors at trial, according to court transcripts.
	Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.
	To get the money from China to Mexico, Gan performed the same sort of mirror transactions, only this time with the help of Chinese businesses who had access to pesos in Mexico. This leg of the journey was described by the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and is outlined in court documents, including the U.S. government's September 2020 sentencing memorandum for Gan and the June 2019 superseding indictment detailing charges against him.
	U.S. prosecutors said the laundered money was delivered to Pan Haiping's Mexican drug cartel clients, according to the superseding indictment. No Mexican banks were named in any of the court documents reviewed by Reuters.
	In October, Reuters traveled to Guadalajara and found Gan's wife, Pan Emi (no relation to Pan Haiping), working in a busy store she owns in the city's Chinese quarter selling wigs, plastic jewelry, sunglasses and other low-cost merchandise imported from China.
	Manning the cash register, Pan Emi said her husband was innocent of wrongdoing and being unfairly portrayed by authorities as a criminal when he was nothing more than a plucky businessman. She said no Mexican or U.S. law enforcement agents had contacted her about the case.
	She said Gan, fed up with high Chinese taxes, had left his shoe factory in the Chinese city of Wenzhou nearly a decade ago seeking a better life in Mexico. In Guadalajara, she said, Gan co-founded a business exporting jellyfish, which are considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac in China. Pan Emi said her ""super friendly"" husband built a large network of friends and contacts in Mexico and was always on the phone.
	Pan Emi confirmed some details of the case. She said her husband knew Pan Haiping and Lim and had participated in currency swaps with other Chinese merchants. But she denied Gan was involved with traffickers or knew anything about drug money.
	She said currency swaps were common in the expatriate Chinese business community to avoid pricey fees and lousy exchange rates offered by banks.
	""These swaps that we do with each other are easy. It's no big problem,"" Pan Emi said. ""I don't think it's illegal.""
	Money brokers like Gan and Pan Haiping are growing in number among the large Chinese diasporas in the United States, Europe and Latin America, according to three DEA officials.
	Demand for their services is being driven by affluent Chinese looking to evade China's currency controls and move wealth abroad, the DEA officials told Reuters. Beijing limits the amount of money its citizens can transfer out of China to the equivalent of $50,000 U.S. dollars annually.
	Latin American cartels, flush with dollars and euros from drug sales, are uniquely placed to satisfy the Chinese appetite for hard currencies. Some Chinese expatriates located in drug-producing countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Peru are the intermediaries bridging these disparate sets of people, said Donald Im, a senior DEA agent and anti-money laundering specialist.
	""When there is need by the cartels for cash to be laundered, and there is demand for cash from the Chinese, you have a perfect marriage made in heaven,"" Im told Reuters. ""The Chinese brokers are very important to the Mexican and Colombian cartels.""
	In the case of Gan, it was a lucrative business, according to conversations between his alleged associates taped by Homeland Security Investigations agents. ""He has made $1 million already because of us, for real,"" Pan Haiping told Lim in August 2017, according to transcripts of intercepted phone communications presented at Gan's trial.
	Chinese money launderers are squeezing out Mexican and Colombian rivals by undercutting them on price by as much as half, U.S. officials said. The Chinese operators have been able to do that because they levy fees on both sides of each transaction. They impose fat commissions as high as 10% on Chinese citizens eager to get money out of China. That allows the Chinese money brokers, in turn, to charge traffickers nominal fees of just a few percentage points. The money launderers still turn a handsome profit while locking in a steady supply of coveted dollars and euros from cartel customers.
	DEA agent Im said the Chinese expats had the ""systems and the infrastructure"" in place not only to launder the drug proceeds but to do it so cheaply that drug cartels receive back ""almost 100%"" of their dirty money.
	Chinese money brokers have also managed to avoid choosing sides in Mexico's cartel wars, even coordinating money contracts with both the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels on the same day, according to a second senior DEA agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	Traffickers use other so-called trade-based money laundering schemes to move drug money from China to Mexico, according to the DEA and Mexican government officials who spoke with Reuters. In July, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit, an investigative agency, said publicly that Chinese nationals laundering money for the Jalisco New Generation cartel were using drug proceeds to buy shoes in bulk from China, then reselling them in Mexico to get the gang their cash.
	Chinese exports to Mexico, including electronics, clothing and other consumer goods, have nearly doubled over the past decade to $83 billion in 2019. The surge has allowed drug cartels and their money launderers to piggyback on this burgeoning trade relationship, authorities said.
	In Guadalajara, Pan Emi said e-mail exchanges with her husband's U.S. lawyers left her optimistic ahead of Gan's looming sentencing. Prosecutors have asked for a 20-year jail term; Gan's defense attorneys have argued for no more than two years.
	Pan Emi said business was going well in Mexico and she had no desire to return to China. ""I hope my husband comes back,"" she said."

              China hits out at U.S. after report of new visa restrictions
          
","
              China on Thursday accused critics in the U.S. government of ""an escalation of political suppression"" against Beijing following a report of new visa restrictions on members of China's ruling Communist Party and their immediate family members.
        ","
                  Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/china-hits-out-at-u-s-after-report-of-new-visa-restrictions-1.5215115,"BEIJING -- 
	China on Thursday accused critics in the U.S. government of ""an escalation of political suppression"" against Beijing following new visa restrictions on members of China's ruling Communist Party and their immediate family members.
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China would ""make representations"" to the U.S. over its decision to limit such people to one-month, single-entry visas.
	Hua called Washington's approach ""totally inconsistent with the U.S.'s own interests,"" and said it would damage America's global image.
	""I think it is obvious to all that this is an escalation of political suppression by some extreme anti-China forces in the U.S. out of strong ideological prejudice and deep-rooted Cold War mentality against China,"" Hua said at a daily briefing.
	The State Department said in a statement Thursday that the new restrictions are intended to protect the U.S. from the Chinese Communist Party's ""malign influence.""
	""For decades we allowed the CCP free and unfettered access to U.S. institutions and businesses while these same privileges were never extended freely to U.S. citizens in China,"" it said.
	It wasn't clear how the restrictions would be enforced since many of the party's 92 million members do not play active public roles in its institutions.
	The restrictions are the latest punitive measure taken against China's leadership and economy amid sharpening disputes over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Taiwan and a host of other issues.
	On Wednesday, the U.S. said it would block imports from a major Chinese producer of cotton goods because of its reliance on workers detained as part of a crackdown on ethnic minorities in China's northwest.
	Washington has already slapped travel bans and financial sanctions on officials connected to the crackdown on Uighurs and other Chinese Muslim groups in Xinjiang, as well as on Chinese and Hong Kong officials it accuses of restricting social and political rights in the semi-autonomous Chinese city through the implementation of a harsh new national security law.
	Diplomatic ties hit a low point over the summer when the U.S. ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston and China responded by demanding the U.S. vacate its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.
	Washington had been loosening restrictions on travel by Chinese to the U.S., seeking to take advantage of the lavish spending habits of China's newly wealthy. Beginning in 2014, Chinese travellers -- whether party members or not -- became eligible for multiple-entry visas valid for 10 years, with stays of 180 days allowed for each entry, while students were permitted visas good for five years. China reciprocated with similar treatment for U.S. citizens.
	Chinese who make up the single largest group of foreign students at American universities have already complained of tougher conditions for obtaining or extending visas. Chinese academics have also faced greater scrutiny, while dozens of journalists with state media have been forced to return home and visa restrictions placed on those remaining, prompting retaliation from Beijing.
	Analysts have long speculated that President Donald Trump will impose harsher measures on China before leaving office on Jan. 20, placing President-elect Joe Biden in a bind in managing the increasingly fractious relationship.

              Phishing ploy targets COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort
          
","
              IBM security researchers say they have detected a cyberespionage effort using targeted phishing emails to try to collect vital information on the World Health Organization's initiative for distributing COVID-19 vaccine to developing countries.
        ","
                  Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/phishing-ploy-targets-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-effort-1.5215096,"BOSTON -- 
	IBM security researchers say they have detected a cyberespionage effort using targeted phishing emails to try to collect vital information on the World Health Organization's initiative for distributing COVID-19 vaccine to developing countries.
	The researchers said they could not be sure who was behind the campaign, which began in September, or if it was successful. But the precision targeting and careful efforts to leave no tracks bore ""the potential hallmarks of nation-state tradecraft,"" they said in a blog post Thursday.
	The campaign's targets, in countries including Germany, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan, are likely associated with the development of the ""cold chain"" needed to ensure coronavirus vaccines get the nonstop sterile refrigeration they need to be effective for the nearly 3 billion people who live where temperature-controlled storage is insufficient, IBM said.
	""Think of it as the bloodline that will be supplying the most vital vaccines globally,"" said Claire Zaboeva, an IBM analyst involved in the detection.
	Whoever is behind the operation could be motivated by a desire to learn how the vaccines are best able to be shipped and stored -- the entire refrigeration process -- in order to copy it, said Nick Rossmann, the IBM team's global threat intelligence lead. Or they might want to be able to undermine a vaccine's legitimacy or launch a disruptive or destructive attack, he added.
	In the ploy, executives with groups likely associated with the initiative known as Covax -- created by the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization and other UN agencies -- were sent spoofed emails appearing to come from an executive of Haier Biomedical, a Chinese company considered the world's main cold-chain supplier, the analyst said.
	The phishing emails had malicious attachments that prompted recipients to enter credentials that could have been used to harvest sensitive information about partners vital to the vaccine-delivery platform.
	Targets included the European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union and companies that make solar panels for powering portable vaccine refrigerators. Other targets were petrochemical companies, likely because they produce dry ice, which is used in the cold chain, Zaboeva said.
	The EU agency has been busy revising new import and export regimes for coronavirus vaccines and would be a gold mine for hackers seeking stepping stones into partnering organizations, she said.
	Covax has struggled to raise enough money to compete for vaccine contracts against the world's wealthiest nations in the race to secure doses as fast as they can be produced. But the UN and Gavi have invested millions in cold-chain equipment across Africa and Asia. The investment, in the works well before the pandemic, was accelerated to prepare for an eventual global rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
	Whoever was behind the phishing operation likely sought ""advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy,"" the blog post said. Coronavirus vaccines will be one of the world's most sought-after products as they are distributed, so theft may also be a danger.
	Last month, Microsoft said it had detected mostly unsuccessful attempts by state-backed Russian and North Korean hackers to steal data from leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers. It gave no information on how many succeeded or how serious those breaches were. Chinese state-backed hackers have also targeted vaccine makers, the U.S. government said in announcing criminal charges in July.
	Microsoft said most of the targets -- located in Canada, France, India, South Korea and the United States -- were researching vaccines and COVID-19 treatments. It did not name the targets.
	On Wednesday, Britain became the first to country to authorize a rigorously tested COVID-19 vaccine, the one developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech.
	Other countries aren't far behind: Regulators not only in the U.S. but in the European Union and Canada also are vetting the Pfizer vaccine along with a shot made by Moderna Inc. British and Canadian regulators are also considering a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
	The logistical challenges of distributing vaccines globally are huge. The Pfizer-BioNTech one must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).

              China testing blunders stemmed from secret deals with firms
          
","
              China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, according to an Associated Press investigation.
        ","
                  Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/china-testing-blunders-stemmed-from-secret-deals-with-firms-1.5215035,"WUHAN, CHINA -- 
	Secrecy and cronyism at China's top disease control agency led to widespread test shortages and flaws that hampered the early response to the coronavirus outbreak, an Associated Press investigation has found.
	China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, according to the investigation. It was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails.
	The Shanghai companies -- GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology -- paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. The price: One million RMB (US$146,600) each, the sources said. It's unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.
	In the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. They took control of patient samples and made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated.
	The flawed testing system -- at a time when the virus could have been slowed -- stopped scientists and officials from seeing how fast it was spreading. Chinese authorities failed to report a single new case between Jan. 5 and 17, even as hundreds were infected in Wuhan, the city where the virus was first detected.
	The apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public or barring large gatherings. It also caused critical shortages of testing kits, barring access to care for many who were infected.
	The testing problems, along with other mistakes and delays, allowed the virus to rip through Wuhan undetected and spread across the world in a pandemic that has now sickened 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.
	China was hardly the only country to grapple with testing. In in the U.S., the CDC declined to use a WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and led to even longer delays than in China. Still, the hiccups in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus.
	""Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.""
	China's foreign ministry and China's top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to requests for comment.
	But interviews and documents suggest that a culture of backdoor connections quietly flourished in a top-down, underfunded public health system. Though none of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits were well-known in the industry, there were extensive ties between the companies and top China CDC researchers.
	The founder of BioGerm, Zhao Baihui, was the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC's microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm's predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC. In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars' worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary. After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao went on to spearhead lucrative contracts with Shanghai officials.
	Zhao did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.
	Another of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China's cabinet. In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal CDC training conference on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits.
	GeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.
	The last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. In an interview, CEO Li Hui said the CDC routinely contracted his company to make emergency testing chemicals. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.
	""We've been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it's normal,"" Li said.
	It's unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law.
	They raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
	But other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under special laws on the procurement of emergency goods during natural disasters.
	""Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,"" said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law. ""I wouldn't be so quick to rush to judgement.""
	The first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests.
	In past outbreaks, the China CDC sent test designs and testing compounds to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen. But this time, they held back the genome and test designs. Instead, they finalized ""technology transfer"" agreements to give the test designs to the Shanghai companies, according to three people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret.
	At the same time, central CDC authorities stymied others from testing. Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. As a result, for weeks, local CDC staff were unable to confirm new cases.
	After a Jan. 14 internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, China's health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again.
	But the test kits from GeneoDx and Huirui had quality issues, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives. And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.
	As a result, in the early days, getting a COVID test was so difficult that Wuhan residents compared it to winning the lottery.
	Among the victims was Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher who started coughing on Jan. 23. When he went to the hospital, he waited for eight hours, only to be turned away for a lack of test kits. Then, when he finally got tested on Jan. 30, it turned out negative, even as the virus ravaged his lungs.
	His second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.
	""There were very, very few tests, basically none -- if you couldn't prove you were positive, you couldn't get admitted to a hospital,"" his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October. ""The doctor said there was nothing that could be done."""

              Australia's economy grew by 3.3 per cent in the third quarter, rebounding from its first recession in nearly three decades as it recovered from pandemic-related shocks.

	Australia's economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, rebounding from its first recession in nearly three decades as it recovered from pandemic-related shocks, according to figures released Wednesday.
	Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters the country still has a lot of ground to make up from the coronavirus downturn.
	""Australia's recession may be over, but Australia's economic recovery is not,"" he said.
	Despite the latest quarterly rise, the economy contracted at a 3.8% annual pace. That's after GDP fell by 0.3% in the first quarter and then by a record 7% in the second quarter.
	""But the Australian economy has demonstrated its remarkable resilience and Australia is as well positioned as any other nation on Earth,"" Frydenberg said. ""Today's national accounts represent a major step forward in Australia's economic recovery.""
	Before this year, Australia had managed to avoid a recession for 28 years. The economy grew even during the global financial crisis thanks to strong demand for Australia's mineral exports and a robust domestic sector.
	The better-than-expected figures were encouraging, economists said.
	""The rebound in Q3 GDP reversed around 40% of the decline during the first half of the year and we expect output to return to pre-virus levels by mid-2021,"" Ben Udy of Capital Economics said in a commentary.
	Now on top of the pandemic, Australia is enduring a spate of rocky relations with China, its biggest trading partner.
	Frydenberg said the situation with China is ""very serious"" but his government is focusing on striking deals with other countries in Asia and beyond.
	""We have great produce, and we have great services, and we have great resource sectors, and I'm very optimistic about the opportunities for our exporters around the world,"" he said.
	Australia's relationship with China worsened this week after a Chinese official tweeted a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.
	Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the image ""repugnant"" and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. But China has not backed down.
	The post took aim at alleged abuses by elite Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.
	Tensions have been growing this year since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the pandemic. China has imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

	The small German biotech firm BioNTech, started by a husband and wife team with Turkish roots, had never brought a vaccine to market before. 
	But its experimental technology has now become the first authorized for use in the Western world to help end the coronavirus pandemic.
	Along with its U.S. partner Pfizer, BioNTech on Wednesday said its COVID-19 vaccine has been granted approval by Britain, with a rollout planned for as early as next week.
	Mainz-based BioNTech was co-founded in 2008 by Ugur Sahin and his wife Ozlem Tureci, both scientists and the children of Turkish immigrants to Germany, as well as Austrian cancer expert Christoph Huber.
	In normal times, BioNTech and its roughly 1,500 employees are focused on developing specialised immunotherapies for cancer patients based on ""messenger RNA"" (mRNA) molecules that trigger the building of proteins in cells, to stimulate the immune system.
	It's this same technology, which has the benefit that it can be developed more quickly than traditional vaccines, that lies at the heart of its COVID-19 shot.
	The vaccine will introduce synthetic mRNA into the human body to trick the immune system into producing the viral proteins needed to provoke a safe but robust offensive against the coronavirus.
	Sahin, 54, jumped into action in January shortly after reading about the emergence of a new and deadly coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. 
	By the time much of the planet was in lockdown in March, BioNTech had developed 20 vaccine candidates based on mRNA technology, he told Der Spiegel weekly.
	Those were eventually whittled down to a handful of the most promising options, with vaccine BNT162b2 now the frontrunner.
	Having struck a deal with U.S. pharma giant Pfizer to work together to develop mRNA-based flu vaccines in 2018, teaming up on a potential coronavirus vaccine was an obvious next move for BioNTech.
	The two companies announced in March that they aimed to jointly develop a COVID-19 jab, ""pairing Pfizer's development, regulatory and commercial capabilities with BioNTech's mRNA vaccine technology and expertise"", they said at the time.
	While global headlines tend to lead with Pfizer's involvement, Sahin insisted to Spiegel: ""It is our technology.""
	The co-operation is a good fit because it allows BioNTech ""to develop and distribute a possible vaccine in the shortest time possible"", he added.
	The BNT162b2 vaccine will require two jabs to be effective.
	BioNTech and Pfizer have said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion in 2021.
	In a clear sign that they were gearing up for mass production, BioNTech in September bought a manufacturing site in Marburg in western Germany from Swiss pharma group Novartis, along with its 300 employees, allowing it to produce millions of additional doses each year.
	BioNTech already has two other production sites in Germany, while at least four Pfizer sites in the United States and Europe will join in the unprecedented effort to roll out a vaccine at record speed.
	Sahin had told AFP in an interview in November that if all the players involved -- governments, pharma companies and vaccine logistics firms -- ""do a really good job"", then ""we can succeed in vaccinating 60 to 70 percent of the population by the autumn of 2021.""
	""And when we've accomplished that then we could have a normal winter. Without another shutdown.""
	Besides Britain, the European Union and a slew of countries including the US and Japan have already placed orders for millions of doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine as nations eagerly await the regulatory nods.
	BioNTech has also struck a deal with Shanghai-based Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which will have the exclusive rights to bring the vaccine to China."

	Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong has been sentenced to 13.5 months in prison after pleading guilty to inciting and organizing an unauthorized protest outside the city's police headquarters last year, during months of unrest over a proposed extradition bill with China.
	Two other activists, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam, were sentenced to 10 months and seven months in prison respectively over the protest on June 21, 2019. Chow faced charges relating to inciting and taking part in the protest, while Lam was charged with inciting the protest.
	The trio -- all former members of the disbanded political party Demosisto -- had been remanded in custody since Nov. 23, and were transferred from prison to court to hear their sentences. Hundreds of supporters turned out at the West Kowloon Magistrates Court Wednesday, as well as a small number of pro-China demonstrators.
	In a letter he wrote in prison, published on his social media accounts prior to sentencing, Wong -- who faced up to three years in jail -- described how he had been placed in solitary confinement after an X-ray allegedly revealed ""foreign objects"" in his stomach. A prison service representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Wong's claims. 
	Wong's lawyer, Jonathan Man, said his client ""was suffering during the period of solitary confinement,"" which he said ended last Thursday. Man added that while Lam was ""okay,"" 23-year-old Chow was struggling in prison, as ""it is the first time she was remanded and (she) was not used to the environment.""
	In a letter posted to Chow's social media accounts prior to Wednesday's sentencing, she wrote that she was having trouble sleeping and was feeling ""under the weather."" Chow added that she was ""very worried"" about the ""high possibility"" of her receiving a jail term. ""I hope that everyone outside the prison walls are doing well,"" she said.
	Wednesday's sentence marks the fourth time Wong has been jailed, and the longest sentence he has received, with previous stints in prison all lasting less than six months.
	In the sentencing document, the court said that ""deterrent sentences are warranted to safeguard public interests.""
	""Once again, the government has used the politically motivated charge of 'inciting others to protest' to prosecute people who have merely spoken out and protested peacefully,"" Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific regional director Yamini Mishra said in a statement.
	""By targeting well-known activists from Hong Kong's largely leaderless protest movement, authorities are sending a warning to anyone who dares openly criticize the government that they could be next.""
	Mishra added that ""even in protests where isolated acts of violence took place and public property was damaged, these should not be attributed to others or the organizers, or to the assembly in general.""
	Wednesday's sentencing was the latest related to the 2019 protests. About 2,000 people have faced charges such as rioting, illegal assembly and possession of weapons.
	Wong himself faces other charges over a rally in October last year, and police have said investigations into the unrest are continuing.
	Last month, a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers were arrested over protests staged in the city's legislature, while a reporter for public broadcaster RTHK was also detained.
	The protests have largely stopped this year, due to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions and the national security law imposed on the city by Beijing in the summer. The law criminalizes secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, and carries with it strict prison terms.
	It was used to bar Wong and a number of other candidates from standing for elections that were due to be held in September, but were postponed because of the coronavirus. Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the parliament by Beijing -- overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong's courts -- on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.
	The move came the same week as the U.S. State Department sanctioned a number of top Chinese officials in Hong Kong for ""threatening the peace, security, and autonomy"" of the city, a move the local government described as ""barbaric interference.""
	Other countries have also criticized China over the ongoing crackdown, with the European Council saying the move to disqualify opposition lawmakers constituted a ""further severe blow"" to freedom of opinion in the city and ""significantly undermines Hong Kong's autonomy.""
	Some in Hong Kong have reacted to the worsening political system by emigrating -- or in the case of those facing prosecution, fleeing abroad.
	This summer, a dozen Hong Kongers were arrested by the Chinese coast guard en route to Taiwan. All are now detained on the mainland and facing a raft of charges. A former independence activist, Tony Chung, was also arrested after allegedly attempting to claim asylum at the US consulate to Hong Kong, along with several others.
	In his letter from prison, Wong urged the public to ""continue to pay attention"" to the 12 detained in China. Separately Tuesday, parliamentarians from 18 countries wrote to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to urge her to intervene on their behalf.
	""In your role as Chief Executive, it is incumbent on you to intercede on behalf of these young people to ensure that they are guaranteed justice,"" the lawmakers wrote, expressing concern about a justice system ""where imprisonment is essentially guaranteed, torture is common and forced confessions are frequently demanded of suspects.""
	""To continue to fail to do so would be a gross abdication of your responsibility to serve the people of Hong Kong and ensure their wellbeing and safety,"" the letter added."

	A Chinese woman who filed a sexual misconduct lawsuit against a TV host told cheering supporters at a courthouse Wednesday that she hopes her case will encourage victims of gender violence in a system that gives them few options to pursue complaints.
	Zhou Xiaoxuan spoke ahead of a trial in her lawsuit, which was delayed for two years and reflects the challenges Chinese women face in pursuing sexual misconduct complaints despite the spread of the global #MeToo movement.
	Zhou, 27, has accused Zhu Jun, a popular state TV host, of forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan (US$7,600) in damages.
	Zhu has denied the accusation and filed a defamation case against Zhou.
	""Even if ultimately in this case we don't get a legal win, as long as we can show to a lot of people (that) there are people like me, those of us who are victims of gender violence, that's already a type of win,"" Zhou said outside the Haidian District People's court in Beijing.
	A verdict was not expected on Wednesday.
	The movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual misconduct.
	The #MeToo global movement helped encourage activism in China, but came at a time when President Xi Jinping's government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.
	Women who complain face censorship and official resistance. The movement has seen few victories, and it was only in 2019 that sexual misconduct was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.
	In a rare victory, a woman who used the alias Liu Li won a case against her former boss in July. The boss, a social worker in the western city of Chengdu, was required to issue a public apology but no damages were awarded.
	""Together, we want to demand answers from history,"" read a sign held by a few dozen supporters outside the courthouse in Beijing on Wednesday. Others carried .Metoo signs.
	Many yelled ""jiayou,"" or ""add oil,"" a common Chinese phrase as reassurance to Zhou, who cried after speaking.
	Videographers working for foreign news agencies were taken away by police soon after Zhou gave her statement. It was unclear why they were held.

              In '76 Days,' a documentary portrait of lockdown in Wuhan
          
","
              '76 Days,' a new documentary shot in four Wuhan hospitals, captures a local horror before it became a global nightmare.
        ","

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/in-76-days-a-documentary-portrait-of-lockdown-in-wuhan-1.5212758,"NEW YORK -- 
	""Papa!"" screams a hospital worker, covered from head to toe in a Hazmat suit and PPE, in the opening moments of the documentary ""76 Days.""
	This is in the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan, back in January and February when the city of 11 million went into a 2 1/2-month lockdown and hospitals were overrun. The health worker's father has just died, and her agony at not being able to sit by his side is overwhelming. Her colleagues restrain her as she sobs, moaning, ""Papa, you'll stay forever in my heart.""
	""76 Days,"" shot in four Wuhan hospitals, captures a local horror before it became a global nightmare. Given the constraints at the time on footage and information from Wuhan, it's a rare window into the infancy of the pandemic. The film is directed by the New York-based filmmaker Hao Wu, who worked with two Chinese journalists -- one named Weixi Chen, the other is remaining anonymous -- to create of a portrait of the virus epicenter.
	Some of the images document the fear and confusion of those early days: A group of patients mill outside the hospital doors, pleading to be let in. Others are by now more familiar: Solitary deaths followed by phone calls to family members.
	""There has been so much news coverage and commentary about the pandemic but most of that has primarily been about statistics and our political divide,"" Wu said in an interview. ""What I think is missing is the human stories, the human faces of the pandemic.""
	That may be especially true for stories of the pandemic from China, which President Donald Trump and his supporters have been highly critical of, blaming it for the ""Wuhan virus."" Wu's film, though, consciously avoids politics to concentrate on the humanity inside the hospitals -- even if the workers are so obscured by their Hazmat suits that they're only identifiable by the names penned in sharpie on their backs.
	""I feel like right now there is such a toxic background to a lot of the discussions around the virus,"" Wu says. ""The virus is an enemy that doesn't care about your nationality.""
	""76 Days,"" which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, is being released Friday by MTV Documentary Films is more than 50 virtual cinemas. Last month, it was nominated for best documentary by the IFP Gotham Awards.
	It's among the first in a coming surge of coronavirus documentaries. A handful have already arrived, some -- snapshots in an ongoing drama -- hurriedly edited even as the scope of the pandemic has continued to expand. In October, Alex Gibney released ""Totally Under Control,"" a two-part indictment of the federal U.S. response to the virus. In August, the artist-activist Ai Weiwei debuted ""Coronation,"" a documentary he directed remotely with dozens of volunteers to capture the lockdown experience for ordinary Chinese people.
	For some, the films are too harsh a reminder of an all-consuming reality. But ""76 Days"" feels like a vital early draft of history. Wu's first instinct had been to create a more straightforwardly journalistic film examining what happened in Wuhan. But Wu -- a Chinese native who lives in New York with his partner and two children (he depicted his journey as a gay man in a traditional Chinese family in the 2019 Netflix documentary ""All in My Family"" ) -- soon recognized the difficulty of access and the rapidly changing situation would make such a film either very difficult or potentially stale by the time it was finished.
	""The images coming out of Wuhan were so harrowing. Everyone was scouring social media, trying to find out what happened in Wuhan, how it got so bad. A lot of us were so angry,"" he says. ""I started getting away from wanting to assign blame.""
	The journalists, working with press passes, would have typically been closely watched by Communist party minders but in the chaos were given more free rein. Wu leaned into a more observational approach without talking heads, and urged his collaborators to focus on the people and the details. One poignant shot shows the ziplocked cellphone of a deceased person quietly ringing.
	Wu's last trip to China was in January and February. Right after he came back, his grandfather was diagnosed with late stage liver cancer. He would die a month later. Wu, unable to visit because of travel restrictions and busy on the film, wasn't able to say goodbye in person.
	""For me, I was compelled to tell the story. It's almost like a tribute to my grandfather,"" says Wu. ""The shots that attracted me were those that showed the details of people willing to be nice to each other. I guess it was guilty about not being able to say goodbye to my grandfather, to hold his hand."""

	A Chinese spacecraft sent to return lunar rocks to Earth collected its first samples Wednesday after landing on the moon, the government announced, adding to a string of successes for Beijing's increasingly ambitious space program.
	The Chang'e 5 probe touched down shortly after 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Tuesday after descending from an orbiter, the China National Space Administration said. It released images of the barren scene at the landing site showing the lander's shadow.
	""Chang'e has collected moon samples,"" the agency said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency. It said the probe also had successfully unfolded solar panels that will power it.
	The probe, launched Nov. 24 from the tropical southern island of Hainan, is the latest venture by a Chinese space program that sent its first astronaut into orbit in 2003, has a spacecraft en route to Mars and aims eventually to land a human on the moon.
	Plans call for the lander to spend about two days drilling into the lunar surface and collecting 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and debris. The top stage of the probe will be launched back into lunar orbit to transfer the samples to a capsule for return to Earth, where it is to land in China's northern grasslands in mid-December.
	If it succeeds, it will be the first time scientists have obtained fresh samples of lunar rocks since a Soviet probe in the 1970s. Those samples are expected to be made available to scientists from other nations, although its unclear how much access NASA will have, given tight U.S. government restrictions on space co-operation with China.
	From the rocks and debris, scientists hope to learn more about the moon, including its precise age, as well as increased knowledge about other bodies in our solar system. Collecting samples, including from asteroids, is an increasing focus of many space programs and China's mastery of the technology once again places it among the leading nations operating in space.
	American and Russian space officials congratulated the Chinese program.
	""Congratulations to China on the successful landing of Chang'e 5. This is no easy task,"" wrote NASA's science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, on Twitter.
	""When the samples collected on the Moon are returned to Earth, we hope everyone will benefit from being able to study this precious cargo that could advance the international science community.""
	The most recent return of lunar rocks to Earth was carried out in 1976 by Luna 24, a Soviet robot probe.
	U.S. astronauts brought back 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of lunar samples from 1969 to 1972, some of which is still being analyzed and experimented on.
	The Chang'e 5 flight is China's third successful lunar landing. Its predecessor, Chang'e 4, was the first probe to land on the moon's little-explored far side.
	Chinese space program officials have said they envision future crewed missions along with robotic ones, including possibly a permanent research base. No timeline or other details have been announced.
	The latest flight includes collaboration with the European Space Agency, which is helping to monitor the mission.
	China's space program has proceeded more cautiously than the U.S.-Soviet space race of the 1960s, which was marked by fatalities and launch failures.
	In 2003, China became the third country to send an astronaut into orbit on its own after the Soviet Union and the United States. It also launched a crewed space station.
	China, along with neighbours Japan and India, also has joined the growing race to explore Mars. The Tianwen 1 probe launched in July is on its way to the red planet carrying a lander and a rover to search for water."

	While many scientists are racing to find vaccines to tame the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, other researchers are probing the past, trying to unravel one of the greatest mysteries of the virus: exactly where it came from.
	The World Health Organization has assembled an international team of 10 scientists to trace the origins of the virus.
	They will have to investigate both the suspect animals and how the first patients may have been infected.
	""We want to know the origin and we will do everything to know the origin,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Monday.
	But success is by no means assured.
	The first cases were reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan a year ago, before countries across the world began to record growing infections.
	The WHO said the first cases in Wuhan are believed to date from the beginning of December.
	But ""where an epidemic is first detected does not necessarily reflect where it started"", it added in a November report.
	In recent months, researchers in various countries have suggested that cases may have gone unnoticed long before December 2019, based on analysis of wastewater or blood samples.
	But there is a lack of ""clear evidence"" to back up these claims, said Etienne Simon-Loriere, of the virology department at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.
	To establish a virus family tree, researchers rely on genetic analysis.
	This can help ""better understand transmission dynamics, particularly how the virus may have evolved over time and how clusters might be related in time and place"", the WHO said.
	Scientists agree that the disease has an animal origin.
	""The big question is what led it to jump into humans,"" Etienne Simon-Loriere told AFP.
	Suspicions have fallen on bats, which are ""a major reservoir for coronaviruses"", he adds.
	But there would likely have been an intermediary animal to shepherd SARS-CoV-2 into people.
	The pangolin -- a mammal subject to rampant regional wildlife smuggling -- was identified as a likely carrier early on based on genetic analysis. But the case is not settled.
	WHO investigators will need to clarify this point by probing the wet market in Wuhan, which sold live and wild animals and has been linked to many of the early cases.
	The team will be armed with clues we did not have at the start of the pandemic.
	Simon-Loriere said they could look out for an animal with a virus receptor, a protein called ACE2, similar to the one found in humans.
	It is through this receptor that the virus latches onto cells.
	Some animals such as mink and ferrets have been found to have a very similar receptor to humans, while others are quite different.
	Another origin theory that swirled in conspiracy rumours for months was that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in the outbreak.
	Against the backdrop of diplomatic tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump touted the idea, claiming the virus could have leaked from the biosafety lab.
	China has rejected the accusations.
	While Simon-Loriere said it was not yet possible to completely rule out the idea that the virus escaped accidentally, he stressed that there was ""no indication it was manmade"".
	""All the elements of its genome have already been observed in nature, mainly in bat coronaviruses,"" he said.
	The WHO says understanding how an epidemic began is ""essential to preventing further introductions to the human population"".
	But it has warned that the process of tracing how a disease jumped from animals ""is a riddle that can take years to solve"".
	""The introduction of a new virus to the human population is one of the greatest mysteries an epidemiologist can hope to unravel,"" it said.
	The goal is to ""understand the mechanism and put in place measures to avoid the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-3, 4, etc."", said Simon-Loriere.
	For example, during the 2002 SARS epidemic, a ban on the consumption of civet cats -- identified as an intermediary host of that coronavirus -- is credited with having helped prevent the reintroduction of the virus into humans.
	The UN health agency sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the probe.
	But it has remained unclear when the larger team will be able to travel to China to start its work.
	In late November the WHO said it hoped to have a larger team of scientists on the ground ""as soon as possible"".
	The U.S. has accused Beijing of not being transparent, while it says the WHO kowtowed to China and dragged its feet in investigating how the outbreak first started.
	Others have voiced concern that the agency may have allowed China to dictate the terms of an international investigation into the origins of the virus.
	Tedros told critics to stop ""politicising"" the issue on Monday."

              New Zealand joins Australia in denouncing China's tweet

              New Zealand has joined Australia in denouncing a graphic tweet posted by a Chinese official that shows a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/new-zealand-joins-australia-in-denouncing-china-s-tweet-1.5211631,"WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND -- 
	New Zealand has joined Australia in denouncing a graphic tweet posted by a Chinese official that shows a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.
	Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that New Zealand has voiced its concerns directly with Chinese authorities.
	""This is an image that wasn't factual. It wasn't correct. And so in keeping with our principled position where images like that are used, we will raise those concerns and we'll do it directly,"" Ardern told reporters.
	China has not backed down from the tweet and said there will be no apology.
	Ardern's criticism was more muted than Australia's. She faced an awkward choice of how far to get involved in a conflict between New Zealand's closest ally, Australia, and its biggest trading partner, China.
	Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called the image ""repugnant"" and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. The post took aim at alleged abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.
	The incident is further souring already tense relations between Australia and China.
	The image, which appeared to show the soldier slitting the child's throat, was posted by Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry. He wrote a caption with his tweet: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.""
	He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the Afghanistan conflict. The report recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.
	Asked about the issue at a daily briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.
	""What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,"" Hua said.
	Morrison said Zhao's tweet was ""utterly outrageous"" and a terrible slur against Australia's military.
	It ""is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,"" he told reporters in Canberra. ""The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes.""
	Morrison said his government contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it on Tuesday but could still be viewed. Zhao's account comes with a Twitter label stating that it's a Chinese government account.
	Despite China blocking Twitter and other U.S. social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.
	Zhao was criticized by the U.S. in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that U.S. soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China's high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.
	Morrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.
	""But this is not how you deal with them,"" he said. ""Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.""
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

	Zhou Xiaoxuan's says her prestigious internship with Chinese state TV soured after a popular host forcibly kissed her.
	Outraged, Zhou took the previously taboo step of filing a lawsuit in 2018, joining the global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. But the ruling Communist Party dislikes such grassroots activism and offers few ways to pursue complaints. Zhou waited two years for a hearing, while the host fought back by filing a defamation lawsuit.
	On Wednesday, Zhou's case goes to trial in Beijing, highlighting the growing willingness of Chinese women to speak up about sexual harassment despite official resistance and censorship that eroded #MeToo's impact.
	""There are very few sexual harassment cases who have a court hearing,"" Zhou said. ""We hope each individual case can be a type of push forward.""
	The ruling party, whose late leader Mao Zedong famously declared, ""women hold up half the sky,"" has improved their legal and social status but is far from delivering on its promise of equality. In some areas, conditions are deteriorating: Women have disappeared from leadership roles over the past three decades.
	#MeToo's global spread helped to encourage activism in China. But that came at a time when President Xi Jinping's government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.
	Women who complain face censorship and official resistance. It was only in 2019 that sexual harassment was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.
	Zhou accuses CCTV host Zhu Jun of groping and forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan (US$7,600) in damages.
	In a series of social media posts, she said she was alone with Zhu in his dressing room for a few minutes. She said he tried to reach into her dress and drag her onto himself, and then forcibly kissed her. The posts were shared widely and reposted by many on the Chinese internet and prompted a great amount of media coverage.
	When Zhou filed suit in 2018, such complaints were treated as labour disputes or under other laws that didn't relate directly to sexual harassment. Zhou's was termed a ""personality rights dispute.""
	Her lawyers have asked for it to be heard under the new legal provision that explicitly cites sexual harassment.
	Zhu, the CCTV host, has denied the allegations. A call to his phone wasn't answered. A person who answered at the number in public records for the law firm that represents him said the firm had moved and had no new number.
	Zhu has a countersuit pending against Zhou asking for damages of 650,000 yuan (US$100,000).
	Zhou expressed hope her case will show ""there are problems in the legal process.""
	The movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment.
	In a rare victory, a woman who used the alias Liu Li won a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in July. The boss, a social worker in the western city of Chengdu, was required to issue a public apology but no damages were awarded.
	Activists want more legislative changes and legal tools.
	""No matter what the result is, we feel that doing this has meaning,"" Zhou said."

	North American stock markets got a boost to start December from additional signs that vaccines could spur a return to economic normalcy in 2021.
	The predominant driver of market activity Tuesday was Pfizer seeking regulatory approval for its COVID-19 vaccine in the European Union, after doing so in the United States, said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager for Fiera Capital.
	“This has extended the optimism on the vaccine front that will inevitably allow for that rapid recovery in 2021,” she said in an interview.
	As a result, investors are largely looking past uncertainties, growing infections and some negative economic implications from new lockdowns as they anticipate a very strong revival in global growth by the end of next year.
	In addition, a bipartisan U.S. Senate proposal for US$900 billion in fiscal stimulus and president-elect Joe Biden's call for a package supported the market rally. However, Bangsund warned that past efforts show that these expectations can prove fleeting and short-lived.
	The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 106.68 points to 17,296.93 after posting an intraday high of 17,471.20 that's less than three per cent off February's record high.
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 185.28 points at 29,823.92. The S&P 500 index was up 40.82 points at 3,662.45, while the Nasdaq composite was up 156.37 points at 12,355.11 after both markets set new record highs in earlier trading.
	Markets started the day in positive territory, with Chinese factory results coming in strong.
	They moved up after posting a phenomenal month in which the S&P 500, for example, experienced its strongest November in decades.
	Bangsund expects December could also be strong, albeit not as good as November given the impact of pandemic-related restrictions.
	“Any setback in the near-term would almost inevitably prove short-lived given that brighter outlook for 2021,” she said.
	Bangsund added that investors are underestimating the magnitude of the eventual recovery because there's a lot of pent-up savings ready to be put to work once there's a return to some sense of normalcy.
	“And when you combine that with a very supportive policy backdrop, it's really going to be a nice year for growth and for equity prices.”
	The Canadian dollar traded for 77.21 cents US, its highest level of the year and compared with 77.13 cents US on Monday.
	The increase came as a result of weakness in the U.S. dollar. Bangsund said it wasn't helped by Canada's economy growing by a record 40.5 per cent on an annualized basis in the third quarter, that was below expectations.
	The TSX was pushed higher by the strength of the materials and heavyweight financials sectors.
	Higher gold and copper prices pushed materials up 2.6 per cent, with shares of Torex Gold Resources Inc. and Eldorado Gold leading with gains of 12.1 and 10.5 per cent, respectively.
	The February gold contract was up US$38.00 at US$1,818.90 an ounce and the March copper contract was up 4.7 cents at more than US$3.48 a pound.
	Financials rose 1.3 per cent with Bank of Montreal shares rising 3.4 per cent and Scotiabank shares up 2.8 per cent after each posted strong quarterly results. The sector was also helped by higher treasury bond yields.
	Technology moved slightly higher as shares in BlackBerry Ltd. gained as much as 63.9 per cent in intraday trading following news of a deal with Amazon Web Services to develop and market BlackBerry's intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY.
	The stock traded as high as $12.54, up from Monday's close of $7.65, before drifting lower and closing at a new 52-week high of $9.08, up 18.7 per cent.
	Energy inched higher even though the January crude contract was down 79 cents at US$44.55 per barrel and the January natural gas contract was down 0.2 of a cent at US$2.88 per mmBTU.
	Health care plunged 5.6 per cent with Aurora Cannabis Inc. losing 17.2 per cent.

              Top secret: Biden gets access to President's Daily Brief
          
","
              Joe Biden has had his first look as president-elect at the President's Daily Brief, a top secret summary of U.S. intelligence and world events -- a document former first lady Michelle Obama has called ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.""
        ","
                  Tuesday, Dec. 1, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/top-secret-biden-gets-access-to-president-s-daily-brief-1.5211392,"WILMINGTON, DEL. -- 
	Joe Biden has had his first look as president-elect at the President's Daily Brief, a top secret summary of U.S. intelligence and world events -- a document former first lady Michelle Obama has called ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.""
	Biden has already had eyes on different iterations of the so-called PDB, which is tailored to the way each president likes to absorb information.
	More than a decade ago, Biden read President George W. Bush's PDB during Biden's transition into the vice presidency. After that, he read President Barack Obama's PDB for eight years. Beginning Monday, after a four-year break, he's reading U.S. President Donald Trump's PDB.
	""The briefers almost certainly will be asking Biden what he prefers in terms of format and style,"" said David Priess, author of ""The President's Book of Secrets,"" a history of the PDB. ""At a minimum, they're seeing what seems to resonate most with him so that when they make the book his book, they can tailor it to him.""
	Obama's PDB was a 10- to 15-page document tucked in a leather binder, which he found waiting for him on the breakfast table. Later in his presidency, he liked reading the ultra-secret intelligence brief on a secured iPad.
	""Michelle called it ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book,"" Obama wrote in his recently released book, ""A Promised Land.""
	""On a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems,"" Obama wrote. ""Nearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable -- a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9-11.""
	From now until Inauguration Day, Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will be reading the PDB crafted for Trump, who had delayed giving Biden and Harris access to it as he contests the outcome of the election.
	Trump, who prefers absorbing information in visual ways, likes short texts and graphics.
	""Trump himself said during his campaign and during the transition in 2016 that he did not like reading long documents -- that he preferred bullet points,"" said Priess, who has not seen any of Trump's PDBs. ""It probably has charts, tables, graphs -- things like that. Not the parody that people make that it's like a cartoon book ... but something that is more visual. But we don't know for sure.""
	The written brief, which Trump doesn't always read, often is followed by a verbal briefing with an intelligence official, although those oral briefings stopped at least for a time in October. Priess said he didn't know why they stopped or if they had resumed, but that they stopped at a time when Trump was spending much of his time on the campaign trail.
	Before Trump authorized Biden to get the PDB as president-elect, Biden was given some intelligence background briefings as a candidate. But they were more general and did not include the nation's top secrets.
	The other thing that a president-elect gets is a briefing ""on CIA's covert actions,"" former acting CIA director Mike Morell said at an event hosted by the Center for Presidential Transition based in Washington. ""It's important for the president-elect to get this briefing ... because on Inauguration Day, these covert actions will become the new president's.""
	In 1961, President John F. Kennedy read his first brief while sitting on the diving board of a swimming pool at his retreat in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. President Lyndon Johnson liked to read his brief in the afternoon. President Richard Nixon relied on his national security adviser Henry Kissinger to peruse the briefs and tell him what he thought the president should know.
	As the laborious recount of ballots dragged on in 2000, President Bill Clinton decided that then-Gov. George W. Bush should get access to his PDB just in case he was the winner. Bush became was the first incoming president to read it before he was president-elect.
	Biden is getting the PDB later than usual because of Trump's ongoing protest of the election results. Trump approved the briefings for Biden last Tuesday, a day after his administration approved the formal transition process to his successor.
	When Biden walks into the Oval Office, he'll be inheriting nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, changing political dynamics in the Middle East, the winding down of America's presence in Afghanistan and rising competition from China.
	Biden had access to the PDB in Wilmington, Delaware. Harris received it in a secure room at the Commerce Department, where the presidential transition offices are located.
	Even Biden, who has decades of experience in foreign policy, could be the victim of an old political adage that no matter how informed he thinks he is, he could learn otherwise from the PDB.
	Former CIA Director Michael Hayden wrote in his book that revelations and new insight found in the PDB are known as ""aw s---"" moments. As in: ""Aw s---,"" he wrote, ""wish we hadn't said that during that campaign stop in Buffalo.""

              Opinion: Is America back? A steep hill to climb for the Biden administration

	Recently, when president-elect Joe Biden introduced the team that will handle foreign and security policy issues in his new administration, he used the slogan ""America is back”.
	Easier to say than achieve, I suspect.
	Firstly, Biden will have a lot of work to do domestically: a pandemic that continues to wreak havoc in the U.S., an economy to rebuild, and above all, trying to bring back unity after a Trump period that divided the United States in unimaginable ways.
	Still, the United States remains a great power, it will have no choice but to play its role on the international scene. The future secretary of state Antony Blinken is well acquainted with international affairs. The next ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat, and John Kerry, former secretary of state under Obama, appointed as special envoy on climate change are both experienced and competent.
	Biden has confirmed a return to multilateralism. Washington is expected to rejoin the Paris Accord on climate change and will reintegrate some international organizations such as the World Health Organization. It is to be expected that the American voice will be heard again at the United Nations in a more cooperative mode. This is good news.
	Biden will also need to repair the damage done by his predecessor by re-establishing normal relations with traditional allies in Europe, Canada and elsewhere.
	It is expected the U.S. will reclaim its usual place in leading NATO. Trump denigrated this organization and worked to weaken it for reasons that escaped observers.
	However, the world has greatly changed during Trump's four years.
	French President Macron, German Chancellor Merkel and European Union leaders are most probably relieved that common sense will return to the White House but, having been burned, they will want to give themselves some time to see how the Americans will behave on a number of trade and other issues.
	Biden said that the U.S. is ready to lead the world again. Not sure it is a universally shared objective. An increased involvement perhaps, but returning to a pre-Trump era may not be possible.
	Prime Minister Trudeau and his team have already begun bilateral contacts, promoting the importance of Canada in the American economy. Relations with our southern neighbour will not necessarily be more favourable to our interests, but at least there will be dialogue and not insults from the president. Nevertheless, there may be a few differences, notably because of Joe Biden's (Buy America) protectionist agenda and his opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline project.
	The big challenges for the next administration will of course be China and probably issues in the Middle East, particularly Iran. It is expected that the confrontational approach with Beijing will be abandoned in favour of an alliance with Europeans and others to make the Chinese understand that it is in their interest to better respect the rule of law and improve the human rights situation. Will this work? Beijing is becoming more and more self-confident. It took advantage of the American withdrawal from the world stage to advance its pawns. It has just signed a free-trade agreement with its Asian neighbours that corresponds to 30 per cent of world trade.
	Biden said the U.S. wants to join the multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran abandoned by Trump. This may not be easy to achieve because his government has adopted a long list of economic sanctions that the Iranians will want to see abandoned before making their own concessions. Negotiations are likely to be long and complicated, and Republican politicians in the Senate, if they remain the majority, will not help. The recent assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist may not be the last attempt by opponents of the agreement to create additional difficulties before the departure of Trump from the White House.
	Elsewhere in the region, relations between Biden and Netanyahu will not be as warm as with Trump, but the link between Israel and the United States should remain strong. Moreover, Biden said that the U.S. Embassy will stay in Jerusalem. The Palestinians hope that their situation will improve with Biden. To a certain extent, it may be the case. The Israelis will not always have the green light in the context of the settlements on the West Bank, for instance, and the U.S. financial assistance for the Palestinians will probably return. But will the US try to revive the peace process? This is doubtful. Israel has strengthened its ties with several Gulf countries recently and the momentum seems to be changing in the region. Not in the direction of a two-state solution.
	The United States will likely show more interest in defending human rights. Some countries like Saudi Arabia or Egypt will not appreciate it.
	Other issues will attract attention, such as migrants from Central America, a region that has suffered greatly from COVID-19, but also climate change. Migration should be managed in a more humane way than under Trump.
	It will also be interesting to see how relations with Trump's great friends the Turkish, Russian and North Korean despots will be. What about Cuba? Trump had scrapped Obama’s openness towards Havana.
	The Americans have lost ground because of Trump's chaotic and uncoordinated policy. It is not clear that the damage is temporary. Let's hope for Biden that ""America is back"" will be a more successful theme than Trudeau's ""Canada is back”.

	Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he wants to know exactly when COVID-19 vaccines will be going into Ontarians' arms.
	Speaking to reporters at an event in Vaughan, Ont. on Monday, the premier said he is no more comfortable about the timeline for immunizations in the province now than he was last week.
	""I have to get answers. I've been asking the federal government. We need to know when we're getting it, how much we're getting and what we're getting,"" Ford said. ""There's different vaccines out there so, to be perfectly frank, I'm not any more comfortable than I was last week.""
	Ford said he would be speaking to vaccine makers, and added that he had a call with Pfizer line up for Monday afternoon.
	""The clock is ticking,"" he said. ""We need answers, and we've worked very collaboratively with the federal government, but, you know, we need the answers. There's three simple answers that we need. We can't find out at the last minute that we're getting vaccines tomorrow.""
	Canada has paid to secure access to as many as 414 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines, as of late November, with an estimated six million doses expected to arrive in the country by March 31, 2021. The federal government has said that it has a $1-billion fund available to use for purchasing vaccines and the first Health Canada approvals could come before Christmas.
	Prime Minister Trudeau created a firestorm last week when he said Canadians would have to wait to be vaccinated for COVID-19 because the first doses off the production lines will be used in the countries where they are made.
	On Sunday, federal Conservative leader Erin O'Toole accused the Trudeau Liberals of waiting until a deal with a Chinese company had fallen through before making deals with Pfizer and Moderna, creating delays for Canadians.
	However, over the weekend, the head of U.S.-based Moderna told the CBC that Canada is ""not at the back of the line"" when it comes to receiving doses of its vaccine candidate. 
	Ford said he's going to be asking the Pfizer CEO when Ontario will be getting its share of vaccines.
	""I'm sure their answer is, well, it's going to go through the federal government. I need a date. I've been asking and asking,"" Ford said. 
	Ford then compared the securing of vaccines to any other major business transaction.
	""When you place an order for hundreds of millions of dollars and you aren't getting answers, either—and I'm not accusing anyone of this—but either something's going on, someone's not being honest, or there's incompetence, or maybe both. I'm not sure. And that's not accusing anyone, the federal government or the pharmaceutical companies, but the clock is ticking,"" the premier said.
	""Everyone's spending hundreds of millions of dollars and you can't give me a delivery date? Unacceptable.""
	In a tweet on Monday, Ford said he also spoke with staff from British drugmaker AstraZeneca. 
			Delivering the COVID-19 vaccines will be one of the biggest logistical challenges our province has ever faced.

	U.S. president-elect Joe Biden and vice-president-elect Kamala Harris will begin receiving the nation's most sensitive secrets Monday as they prepare to assume office on Jan 20.
	The pair are to receive the highly classified Presidential Daily Brief, a summary of the most important information collected across the U.S. intelligence community that is prepared and delivered by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Outgoing President Donald Trump approved the briefings for Biden last Tuesday, a day after his administration approved the formal transition process to his successor.
	It was not immediately clear how Biden and Harris would receive the briefing, which is tailored to the needs and interests of its top recipient. For Trump, that has meant a focus on visuals and a preference for paper. His predecessor, Barack Obama, came to embrace the briefing being presented on a modified secure tablet. Given its sensitivity, the leather-bound briefing is usually delivered in person by a career member of the intelligence community, though Trump has increasingly let that process lapse.
	""On a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems,"" Obama wrote in his memoir. ""Nearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable--a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9-11.""
	He added that his wife, Michelle, called it ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.""
	Much of the information in the PDB requires no immediate response, Obama wrote, ""The goal was to have a continuously up-to-date sense of all that was roiling in the world, the large, small, and sometimes barely perceptible shifts that threatened to upset whatever equilibrium we were trying to maintain.""
	The PDB, as it is known, is just one component of the intelligence briefings presented to an incoming administration. Biden and Harris will also be able to receive in-depth subject matter briefings from intelligence experts, as well as a run-down of extremely classified covert operations underway during the Trump administration, the latter necessary to determine if they want to maintain or modify those operations once they assume office."

              U.K. to ban new Huawei gear installations after September
          
","
              Wireless carriers in the U.K. won't be allowed to install Huawei equipment in their high-speed 5G networks after September 2021, the British government said Monday, hardening its line against the Chinese technology company.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/u-k-to-ban-new-huawei-gear-installations-after-september-1.5209972,"LONDON -- 
	Wireless carriers in the U.K. won't be allowed to install Huawei equipment in their high-speed 5G networks after September 2021, the British government said Monday, hardening its line against the Chinese technology company.
	The deadline is part of a roadmap the British government is laying down to remove ""high risk"" equipment suppliers with draft legislation that aims to tighten telecommunications security requirements.
	The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July banned Huawei from having a role in building Britain's next-generation mobile phone networks over security concerns triggered by U.S. sanctions. Britain and other European countries have started to fall in line after the U.S. lobbied allies to shun Huawei over fears its equipment could be used by China's communist rulers to facilitate electronic espionage.
	Telecom operators were ordered to stop buying Huawei 5G equipment by the end of the year and have until 2027 to rip any of the company's existing gear out of their systems.
	While the ban implied operators would have to stop installing Huawei gear, the latest announcement spells out the deadline clearly - making it harder for them to stockpile equipment.
	Huawei declined to comment. It has previously denied the U.S. allegations and said Britain's ban was politically motivated.
	""Today I am setting out a clear path for the complete removal of high risk vendors from our 5G networks,"" Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said. ""This will be done through new and unprecedented powers to identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security.""
	The Telecommunications (Security) Bill, which is set to be debated in Parliament on Tuesday, requires tougher security standards for 5G wireless and fiber optic networks and threatens heavy fines for companies that don't comply with the rules.
	The government is also setting out a strategy to diversify its telecom equipment suppliers, including a research lab and investment in open radio standards technology. Huawei has just a handful of rivals including Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson, raising fears that relying on so few companies to supply critical infrastructure leaves networks open to vulnerabilities."

              Moderna asking U.S., European regulators to OK its COVID-19 shots

	Moderna Inc. said it would ask U.S. and European regulators Monday to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine as new study results confirm the shots offer strong protection -- ramping up the race to begin limited vaccinations as the coronavirus rampage worsens.
	Multiple vaccine candidates must succeed for the world to stamp out the pandemic, which has been on the upswing in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. hospitals have been stretched to the limit as the nation has seen more than 160,000 new cases per day and more than 1,400 daily deaths. Since first emerging nearly a year ago in China, the virus has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide.
	Moderna is one of several companies to have already submitted partial data to a ""rolling review"" process offered by Health Canada. Rather than presenting regulators with a complete package of trial results, the would-be vaccine-makers file data and findings as they become available. Canada has been looking at Moderna's first results since mid-October.
	Canada has a different approval process than the United States and European countries, meaning that Moderna and Pfizer do not have to apply or reapply at each step. Instead, they have to submit their newest data and findings.
	Moderna created its shots with the U.S. National Institutes of Health and already had a hint they were working, but said it got the final needed results over the weekend that suggest the vaccine is more than 94% effective.
	Of 196 COVID-19 cases so far in its huge U.S. study, 185 were trial participants who received the placebo and 11 who got the real vaccine. The only people who got severely ill -- 30 participants, including one who died -- had received dummy shots, said Dr. Tal Zaks, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, company's chief medical officer.
	When he learned the results, ""I allowed myself to cry for the first time,"" Zaks told The Associated Press. ""We have already, just in the trial, have already saved lives. Just imagine the impact then multiplied to the people who can get this vaccine.""
	Moderna said the shots' effectiveness and a good safety record so far -- with only temporary, flu-like side effects -- mean they meet requirements set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use before the final-stage testing is complete. The European Medicines Agency, Europe's version of FDA, has signalled it also is open to faster, emergency clearance.
	The FDA has pledged that before it decides to roll out any COVID-19 vaccines, its scientific advisers will publicly debate whether there's enough evidence behind each candidate.
	First up on Dec. 10, Pfizer and BioNTech will present data suggesting their vaccine candidate is 95% effective. Moderna said its turn at this ""science court"" is expected exactly a week later, on Dec. 17.
	If the FDA allows emergency use, Moderna expects to have 20 million doses ready for the U.S. by year's end. Recipients will need two doses, so that's enough for 10 million people.
	Pfizer expects to have 50 million doses globally in December. Half of them -- or enough for 12.5 million people -- are earmarked for the U.S.
	This week, a different panel of U.S. experts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will meet to decide how initial supplies will be given out. They're expected to reserve scarce first doses for health care workers and, if the shots work well enough in the frail elderly, for residents of long-term care facilities. As more vaccine gradually becomes available in coming months, other essential workers and people at highest risk from the coronavirus would get in line. But enough for the general population isn't expected until at least spring.
	Outside the U.S., Zaks said significant supplies from Moderna would be available later, ""in the first quarter"" of next year.
	""Obviously we are doing everything in our power to increase the capacity and accelerate the timelines,"" he said.
	Both Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines are made with the same technology, using a piece of genetic code for the ""spike"" protein that studs the virus. That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, training immune cells to recognize it if the real virus eventually comes along.
	AstraZeneca last week announced confusing early results of its vaccine candidate from research in Britain and Brazil
	That vaccine appears 62% effective when tested as originally intended, with recipients given two full doses. But because of a manufacturing error, a small number of volunteers got a lower first dose -- and AstraZeneca said in that group, the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective.
	Experts say it's unclear why the lower-dose approach would work better and that it may just be a statistical quirk.
	A larger U.S. study of the AstraZeneca candidate still is underway that should eventually give the FDA a better picture of how well it works. The FDA has said any COVID-19 vaccine would have to be at least 50% effective.
	Meanwhile Britain's government will have to decide whether its U.K. data is sufficient for an early rollout there.
	Johnson & Johnson also is in final-stage testing in the U.S. and several other countries to see if its vaccine candidate could work with just one dose.
	Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines work by using harmless cold viruses to carry the spike protein gene into the body and prime the immune system.
	The different technologies have ramifications for how easily different vaccines could be distributed globally. The AstraZeneca shots won't require freezer storage like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
	Candidates made with still other technologies are in late-stage testing, too. Another U.S. company, Novavax Inc., announced Monday that it has finished enrolling 15,000 people in a late-stage study in Britain and plans to begin recruiting even more volunteers for final testing in the U.S. and Mexico ""in the coming weeks.""
	Vaccines made by three Chinese companies and a Russian candidate also are being tested in thousands of people in countries around the world.

	Australia's prime minister said Monday that a Chinese official's tweet showing a fake image of an Australian soldier appearing to slit a child's throat was ""truly repugnant"" and merits an apology.
	China said there would be no apology.
	The incident is further souring already tense relations between the two nations. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was seeking an apology from the Chinese government after Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, posted the graphic image that shows a grinning soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of a veiled child, who is holding a lamb.
	Zhao wrote a caption with the tweet saying: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.""
	He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the conflict in Afghanistan. It recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.
	Asked about the issue at a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.
	""What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,"" Hua said.
	Morrison said Zhao's tweet was ""utterly outrageous"" and a terrible slur against Australia's military.
	It ""is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,"" he told reporters in Canberra. ""The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes.""
	Morrison said his government had contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it by Monday afternoon but could still be viewed. Zhao's account comes with a Twitter label stating that it's a Chinese government account.
	Despite China blocking Twitter and other U.S. social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.
	Zhao was criticized by the U.S. in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that U.S. soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China's high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.
	Morrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.
	""But this is not how you deal with them,"" he said. ""Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.""
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

              PM put all vaccine 'eggs' in one basket, didn't consider other options: O'Toole
          
","
              Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole accused the Liberal government Sunday of putting too much emphasis on partnering with a Chinese company for a COVID-19 vaccine in what turned out to be a failed deal.

	Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole accused the Liberal government Sunday of putting too much emphasis on partnering with a Chinese company for a COVID-19 vaccine in what turned out to be a failed deal.
	O'Toole said the Trudeau government only turned its attention to pre-ordering tens of millions of vaccine doses from companies such as Pfizer and Moderna in August when its collaboration between the National Research Council and Chinese vaccine-maker CanSino finally collapsed after months of delays.
	The Council had issued CanSino a licence to use a Canadian biological product as part of a COVID-19 vaccine. CanSino was supposed to provide samples of the vaccine for clinical trials at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University, but the Chinese government blocked the shipments.
	""I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,"" O'Toole said at a morning news conference.
	""If you look at the timeline, that's when Canada started getting serious with Pfizer, Moderna, the other options,"" he added, saying he was concerned that ""the Trudeau government was willing to almost double down on partnering with China"" earlier in the pandemic.
	The government announced its major vaccine purchases in August after it confirmed the CanSino partnership had fallen through. At the time, it said its decision had come after careful consultations with its vaccine task force of health experts.
	The CanSino partnership with Dalhousie predated the deep freeze in Canada-China relations that occurred after the People's Republic imprisoned two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in apparent retaliation for the RCMP's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou nearly two years ago on an American extradition warrant.
	This past week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau created a firestorm when he said Canadians will have to wait a bit to get vaccinated for COVID-19 because the first doses off the production lines will be used in the countries where they are made.
	As questions grew about the CanSino deal, Trudeau continued to defend his government's vaccine procurement policy, which he says has secured multiple options for the country. Trudeau also appointed a Canadian Forces general to lead the logistics of an eventual vaccine rollout with the Public Health Agency of Canada.
	The chairman of American vaccine maker Moderna told the CBC on Sunday that Canada is near the front of the line to receive 20 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it pre-ordered.
	Noubar Afeyan was asked on CBC's Rosemary Barton Live whether the fact that Canada committed to pre-purchase its doses before other jurisdictions means it will get its supply first. Afeyan confirmed that was the case.
	""The people who are willing to move early on with even less proof of the efficacy have assured the amount of supply they were willing to sign up to,"" he said.
	O'Toole said with Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland poised to deliver the government's long-awaited fiscal update on Monday, the Liberals need to do two things to spur economic recovery: offer a better plan on how it will rollout vaccines for Canadians and step up the distribution of rapid tests.
	""There can't be a full economy, a growing economy, people working, people being productive without the tools to keep that happening in a pandemic. Those two tools are rapid tests, and a vaccine.""
	Freeland's fall economic statement is expected to give a full accounting of the government's record spending on programs to combat the pandemic. In July, the deficit was forecast to be at a record $343.2 billion but some estimates say it could easily top $400 billion.
	The government could announce new spending such as taking steps towards a national child-care system, and relief for battered industries such as travel and restaurants that will face an uphill struggle to recover from the pandemic.
	NDP finance critic Peter Julian sent Freeland a three-page letter urging her to take action on a variety of fronts to help struggling Canadian families during the pandemic.
	They included taking concrete action on establishing a national pharmacare plan to help Canadians pay for soaring prescription drug costs, and establish a national day-care strategy to help women who have been disproportionately hindered by the pandemic. Julien also urged Freeland to help Indigenous communities and abandon the government's plans to pay for the Trans-Mountain Pipeline and ramp up its fight against climate change.
	Green party Leader Annamie Paul called on Freeland to deliver ""a positive vision for a green recovery"" to accelerate Canada's transition to a carbon-neutral economy.
	""We are optimistic that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be widely available next year and so we must be prepared for what comes next,"" Paul said in a statement.

	The Chinese journalist targeted by an ongoing protest in a Surrey cul-de-sac that turned violent this week says he wants the city and the police to step in before more people get hurt.
	Benson Gao says he warned Surrey officials multiple times about the dozen or so people that have gathered constantly outside his house, claiming to be part of a group with ties to a Chinese tycoon on the lam and a former advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump.
	And he’s hoping they’ll do something — now that home surveillance video shows a brutal attack on his friend, Louis Huang, who was sucker-punched, tackled, and kicked multiple times in the head.
	“First I was really angry, and then I was depressed,” Gao told CTV News through a translator. “We told the police again and again that such violence would happen.”
	He says his family has had to stay inside, and he has had to keep his 10-year-old daughter from the people involved in the protest, where people in matching blue rain covers march along the street in front of his house, and stream video from their devices constantly.
	“I thought I lived in a democracy, but I am living in terror,” Gao said.
	The protesters themselves didn’t respond to questions in person in the cul-de-sac Wednesday. They have leafletted homes claiming to be part of the New Federal State of China, a group founded by former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon, and Chinese tycoon Miles Guo, who is living in exile in New York.
	The aims of the protesters, and Gao, sound similar: they’re both criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. Guo’s group has claimed that Gao is in league with the CCP. But documents filed in an American court allege it’s actually Guo who is working with the Chinese government to target critics abroad. Guo has denied this.
	The Surrey RCMP has arrested two people for the assault, said spokesperson Cpl. Elenore Sturko. But it has so far held off any action against the protest in general.
	“We have lawful assembly and we can peacefully protest,” she said. “The difference is whether or not lawful activity is taking place.”
	The City of Surrey said its bylaw officers had attended but found that there were no obstructions of traffic or bylaw violations.
	Lawyer Martin Peters said authorities have a fact pattern that could point them to a Criminal Code offence of harassment.
	“It’s classic language of the Criminal Code, watching and besetting a dwelling house,” he said, adding that if the evidence shows this is an organized attempt to harass Gao, anyone involved, including the people at the top, could be liable.
	He said Gao or the City of Surrey could also apply to get a civil injunction, which could require a buffer zone between the protesters and Gao’s home. That was part of the order during the protests of the TransMountain pipeline, where the City of Burnaby was represented in court.
	Police have protected the protesters’ Charter freedoms so far, Peters said, but it seems that the protest is infringing on Gao’s own Charter freedoms.
	“This is probably designed to have a chilling effect on this journalist,” Peter said.
	Several city councillors didn’t respond to inquires by CTV News.
	If there's no further action, Gao said he plans to sue the city and the RCMP for failing to keep the peace."

	A spokesman for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his office accidentally sent out an account of a phone call with Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole that hadn't happened yet.
	The premature account of the call Friday said Trudeau chided O'Toole about Conservative MPs' downplaying the deaths of Albertans and comparing the novel coronavirus to the flu.
	Alberta MP Rachael Harder shared a newspaper column on her Facebook page this week that pointed out provincial statistics saying that just 10 of 369 Albertans who had died of COVID-19 as of mid-November were otherwise healthy. And Ontario MP Dean Allison described COVID-19 as ""influenza"" in a talk-radio interview.
	After the call, the Conservatives said Trudeau raised neither of these incidents with O'Toole.
	And a second read-out of the call from the PMO, after the call had actually taken place, dropped all mention of the matter.
	It said simply that the two leaders had discussed “the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as vaccine distribution in Canada,” along with issues related to president-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration in the United States.
	The Tory leader went into the conversation with proposals for how Canada can improve its relationship with the U.S. under Biden.
	In a letter to Trudeau, O'Toole said responding to the COVID-19 pandemic must be the first priority, including ensuring a continent-wide response to vaccine supply, the production of personal protective equipment and managing the border.
	O'Toole said after that must come dealing with the threat posed by China, and that Canada should seek to join an existing dialogue among the U.S., Australia, India and Japan to oppose Chinese military expansionism.
	The letter also talks about the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project that outgoing President Donald Trump approved but Biden opposes. O'Toole said it must be made clear to Biden the project is important to Canada's view of the bilateral relationship with the U.S.
	The letter cites a need for a collective effort on combating climate change, and a call to modernize the binational defence agreement known as Norad, which would include having Canada join the ballistic missile defence program.
	A copy of O'Toole's letter to Trudeau was obtained by The Canadian Press.
	“This period of transition to the incoming Biden administration represents a unique opportunity to advance Canada's interests and values on the world stage,” O'Toole wrote in the letter.
	“It is my sincere hope the Canadian and U.S. governments can work together for the mutual benefit of both our peoples who have endured so much this past year.”
	A Conservative read-out after the call said the two leaders concluded their chat by mutually “reaffirming the importance of eliminating COVID-19 and by wishing their families well.”

	On the morning of Dec. 1, 2018, Meng Wanzhou, the Chief Financial Officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei and the daughter of its founder, touched down in Vancouver.
	Meng planned to visit one of her two Vancouver homes to drop off some boxes, then catch an evening flight to Mexico City.
	Eventually, she planned to continue on a trip that would take her to Costa Rica and the G20 in Argentina, with a stop in Paris on the way home.
	Instead, as she stood up from her business class seat onboard the Cathay Pacific 777, and stepped into the glass jetway, she was approached by two Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers.
	One of them checked her Hong Kong passport to confirm her identity, then asked for her phones: one white iPhone 7 Plus, and one red Huawei 20 RS Porsche Design, which Meng handed over to him.
	The other officer placed the phones in mylar bags provided by the RCMP, who had made the request to the CBSA on behalf of the FBI, then put them in his cargo pants pocket.
	Three RCMP officers stood watching out of view nearby.
	 
	The CBSA officers escorted Meng to the main international arrivals hall, where a kiosk spit out a receipt directing the executive to what's known as ""secondary inspection.""
	The officers, along with a supervisor, searched Meng's luggage, and questioned her on-and-off for two hours and 36 minutes, as part of what they called a routine admissibility exam.
	Those officers have since testified they had concerns related to national security and serious criminality.
	During that exam, Mounties waited in a supervisors' office that was within view of Meng, they have testified, but out of earshot.
	In the final moments of the exam, a CBSA officer asked Meng for the passcodes to her phones, which she provided, and which he wrote down both in his notebook and on a loose sheet of paper.

	Three hours after she landed, Meng was arrested by the RCMP.
	Mounties informed her she was facing bank and wire fraud charges in the U.S. and that there was a request for her extradition.
	The charges dealt with allegations surrounding Meng's role in Huawei's business dealings in Iran, and how Meng's alleged actions put a bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions.
	Meng and Huawei have repeatedly denied any wrong doing.
	An RCMP constable, with a Mandarin-speaking constable standing by, read Meng her Charter rights and asked if she wanted to contact a lawyer.
	RCMP also took custody of her electronic devices, including the loose sheet of paper with the passcodes to her phones.
	Meng's luggage, house keys, and the code to her home alarm system were given to a friend who had been waiting to meet her.
	 
	Nearly two years after that day, Meng hasn't left Canada.
	She remains under virtual house arrest, on $10 million bail and conditions that require her to wear an ankle-monitoring bracelet, abide by a curfew, and to pay for her own private security team to prevent her from leaving the country.
	Meanwhile, two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, who were arrested in China just days after Meng's arrest, have been charged with spying by Beijing.
	The ""two Michaels,"" as they've come to be known, have spent nearly two years in jail with little-to-no access to consular officials.

 Meng Wanzhou, right, leaves home for a court appearance in downtown Vancouver on Wednesday, May 8, 2019. 
	Meng's lawyers allege that the RCMP and CBSA co-ordinated and conspired with U.S. authorities to delay her arrest in order to extract evidence that could help the U.S. prove its case.
	Her defence team alleges the actions taken by the RCMP and CBSA, both of whom Meng is also suing, violated her rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
	They argue that the violations amount to an ""abuse of process"" of Canadian justice so grave, that the extradition case against her, currently being heard in B.C. Supreme Court, should be halted.
	RCMP, CBSA, and the individual officers and supervisors involved in the case, with a few exceptions, have repeatedly denied any and all wrong doing.
	For the very first time, the RCMP and CBSA officers who came into contact with Meng Wanzhou that day, along with their supervisors, have told their version of how the encounter unfolded.
	Over the past few weeks, they've answered questions from both the attorney general and Meng's defence lawyers about the circumstances surrounding her arrival, her questioning, her arrest, and her electronic devices. Meng's defence team plans to use any gaps, doubts, and discrepancies from the witness testimony as they make their abuse of process arguments before Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in early 2021. They also plan to make arguments that Meng is a political pawn in a trade war between Beijing and Washington, and that the U.S. cherry-picked evidence, while excluding potentially exculpatory facts, in order to mislead Canadian courts.
	Depending on her findings surrounding Meng's abuse of process claims, Justice Holmes may eventually have to decide if there is also sufficient evidence in the case to extradite Meng to the U.S. Experts have said appeals, if the judge rules against Meng, could take years.
	What follows is some of the more revealing testimony from key witnesses in October and November 2020, and how it may impact a case that's put both Vancouver and Canada at the centre of a political and economic battle between two global superpowers.
	 

RCMP Const. Winston Yep testifies in October 2020 in B.C. Supreme Court (Sketch by Jane Wolsak)
	Const. Yep, who worked for an RCMP unit at B.C. headquarters that handles requests from outside jurisdictions, testified he first learned about the U.S. extradition request the afternoon before Meng arrived. He swore an affidavit in order to obtain a Provisional Arrest Warrant, which said Meng appeared to have no ties to Canada. Yep later learned Meng had two homes in Vancouver, but admitted in his testimony he never made any effort to correct the affidavit.
	The evening of Nov. 30, Yep testified, he and a colleague, Const. Gurvinder Dhaliwal met with CBSA personnel at YVR. Yep testified that the purpose of the meeting was to confirm if Meng was on the flight from Hong Kong, not to discuss the plan for the arrest. That evening, he testified, he became aware an RCMP higher-up had suggested Yep arrest Meng onboard the plane. ""It was just a suggestion,"" Yep testified.
	On the morning of Dec. 1, Yep, Dhaliwal and other Mounties joined members of the CBSA at YVR in a meeting in a supervisors' office. Yep testified he had ""safety concerns"" about arresting Meng on the plane. Defence lawyer Richard Peck pushed back and suggested Yep was lying: ""My view is that is not an honest answer. Safety was never an issue,"" Peck alleged. Yep disputed Peck's allegation, in part, by responding that safety, when it comes to arrests, is always an issue.
	During the morning meeting, Yep testified, it was decided CBSA would meet Meng at the plane. Two CBSA officers would conduct an admissibility exam for immigration and customs purposes in the secondary inspection area, before handing Meng over to the RCMP who would arrest her. Yep testified that Mounties asked CBSA officers to take Meng's phones and place them in mylar bags so they couldn't be remotely wiped, at the request of the FBI.
	With respect to the CBSA exam, Yep testified the delay was ""not intentional"" and that three hours was ""not unreasonable."" He testified that Mounties had no contact with Meng and while they waited in a CBSA supervisor's office nearby, they had ""no influence"" with the CBSA process.
	Yep also said he never asked CBSA officers, nor could he recall any fellow RCMP member asking the CBSA, to obtain any information from Meng during their exam.

RCMP Const. Gurvinder Dhaliwal testifies in November 2020 in B.C. Supreme Court (Sketch by Felicity Don)
	Const. Dhaliwal testified while his colleague, Const. Yep, was the arresting officer, he took on more of a communications role, as well as responsibility for Meng's electronic devices.
	He attended the Nov. 30 meeting with Yep at YVR, which he called a ""brainstorming session"" and testified he recalled a CBSA supervisor suggesting that the RCMP could arrest Meng Wanzhou in the jetway.
	Dhaliwal testified that at the Dec. 1 morning meeting, he could not recall who decided CBSA would take the lead and complete its exam before RCMP could arrest Meng. He indicated that he did not read the arrest warrant until days later. Dhaliwal also testified that he, Yep, and their direct supervisor, Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf were within view of the gate when two CBSA officers identified Meng, asked her for her phones, and placed them in the bags, he testified.
	During the CBSA exam, Dhaliwal testified he was charged with making regular updates to his unit as well as to a Canada Department of Justice lawyer.
	Dhaliwal testified that he did not direct the CBSA in its exam or pose any suggestions about what questions its officers should ask.
	After Yep arrested Meng, Dhaliwal took custody of Meng's two phones, laptop, tablet, and a USB flash drive. He testified that CBSA Officer Scott Kirkland also handed him a loose sheet of paper with the passcodes for Meng's phones. Dhaliwal testified he ""didn't even think about it"" and just put the paper with the phones. He said at no point did he or any RCMP member ask CBSA to obtain Meng's passcodes.
	Dhaliwal also testified about his dealings with RCMP Staff Sgt. Ben Chang, who led a team within the B.C. RCMP's Financial Integrity Unit. Email records from three days after Meng's arrest show Chang had been in touch with an FBI legal attaché. Those emails show Chang requested Dhaliwal to document and provide him with identifying information for Meng's devices, including serial numbers and photos.
	According to her notes, Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf, Dhaliwal's direct supervisor, wrote that Dhaliwal later told her that Chang shared those numbers with the FBI. Dhaliwal testified he did not recall telling Vander Graaf what she wrote in her notes, and did not believe any RCMP member, including Chang, illegally provided evidence to U.S. law enforcement.

RCMP Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf testifies in November 2020 in B.C. Supreme Court (Sketch by Felicity Don)
	Sgt. Vander Graaf, who testified she started as a patrol officer in Surrey and has two decades of policing experience, is one of the senior Mounties ultimately responsible for Meng's arrest. She testified she first learned about the extradition request the afternoon of Nov. 30, and was in touch with constables Yep & Dhaliwal throughout the afternoon and evening.
	Vander Graaf testified that during a phone call with her supervisor, Acting Insp. Peter Lea, Lea made a ""strong suggestion"" that RCMP arrest Meng onboard the plane. Vander Graaf conveyed that message to Dhaliwal Friday night, but also testified she told him it would be fine to alter that plan if there was a reason.
	On Dec. 1, Vander Graaf was on a scheduled day off. But that morning, she testified, she received a call from Sgt. Ross Lundie, a Richmond Mountie stationed at YVR, who told her he wanted another senior officer onsite.
	Vander Graaf's notes show she arrived late to the meeting with CBSA. By the time she joined, she testified, the decision for CBSA to conduct its admissibility exam first, had already been made. Defence lawyer Scott Fenton asked if she expressed concerns, or called her boss to make him aware of the change in plan. Vander Graaf testified she did not object and did not think she called her supervisor. She also told Fenton that she had safety concerns about arresting Meng on the plane. When Fenton accused her of ""making this up into a much bigger thing (than it was),"" Vander Graaf denied the accusation, and testified her concerns surrounding safety were genuine.
	In revealing testimony that verged on combative, Vander Graaf also admitted she didn't read the arrest warrant, which called for Meng's ""immediate arrest,"" until 15 or 20 minutes before the flight landed from Hong Kong. Fenton pointedly suggested that because she hadn't read the warrant, Vander Graaf never took what he called a ""commandment for immediate arrest"" into consideration.
	Vander Graaf also testified she did not know how long CBSA's exam of Meng would take because it was ""their process."" When Fenton asked her if, hypothetically, the CBSA exam had taken two days, if the RCMP arrest would still be considered ""immediate,"" she replied: ""That could be, yes.""
	Defence also established that there had been some sort of ""chit-chat"" between CBSA and RCMP during the exam because Vander Graaf had written in her notes at the time Meng was carrying household goods, and the only place that detail could have come from, defence pointed out, was the CBSA.
	When it came to Meng's phones and the paper with her passcodes, Vander Graaf testified she told Dhaliwal to log them, because ""he couldn't unseize something that he'd already seized,"" and that giving them back to Meng would be ""less transparent.""
	Regarding her notes that Dhaliwal told her on Dec, 12 that RCMP Staff Sgt. Ben Chang had illegally provided identifying information about Meng's devices to the FBI, Vander Graaf stuck by her notes, then testified her concerns were later assuaged after she reviewed emails between Dhaliwal and Chang. Vander Graaf said she didn't take any further action because the emails, she said, provided more context and did not specifically indicate the evidence had been illegally shared. She also testified that she would have ""left it alone regardless"" because it was Chang's responsibility.
	In a fiery exchange, Fenton accused Vander Graaf of lying on the stand, and ""developing a memory,"" because he said her testimony about some of those emails was inconsistent with an affidavit she filed in 2019, where she wrote she had no independent recollection about those same emails.
	Meng's lawyer accused her of ""tailoring her evidence"" to protect the RCMP and to cover up alleged information sharing with the FBI.
	""That is absolutely not true,"" Vander Graaf said.

A court sketch from Jane Wolsak shows RCMP Sgt. Ross Lundie.
	Sgt. Lundie appears to have been one of the first Mounties aware that something unusual was about to transpire.
	As a supervisor for YVR office of the Richmond RCMP detachment, he testified he got a call from a colleague in Ottawa a week before Meng’s arrival. Lundie said the colleague asked questions about the “flow” of arriving international travelers at YVR, and whether a traveller could exit the airport without encountering a CBSA officer.
	Lundie, who joined the RCMP in the late 1990s, testified he did not learn the name of the arriving traveler until the evening of Nov. 30, when he was asked to provide assistance to the RCMP’s Foreign Domestic Liaison Unit, as well as provide a Mandarin-speaking constable the next day.
	Lundie testified that he talked to constables Dhaliwal and Yep that evening on the phone, who raised the idea of arresting Meng on the plane. He testified that he “had concerns with that right off the bat.” He had years of experience working alongside CBSA officers, Lundie said, and “it’s not something that we do,” he testified, unless there is an “immediate public safety risk.”
	That evening, Lundie testified, he exchanged emails with higher-ups about Meng, telling some of them to “Google the name,” realizing she was “extremely high profile.”
	On Dec. 1, Lundie woke up to emails from FBI legal attaché Sherri Onks, who he had previously met, and who asked him to keep her posted on Meng’s arrest. Lundie testified the request seemed “reasonable” but also that he was not the lead on the case, instead indicating the RCMP’s Foreign Domestic Liaison Unit under Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf.
	Lundie attended the morning meeting at YVR with constables Yep and Dhaliwal and members of the CBSA. He testified that he suggested that CBSA conduct their examination of Meng first, and RCMP would arrest her after. Lundie said CBSA left the room to discuss, then returned and agreed, saying “that made sense.”
	He also testified that he told CBSA that RCMP would not direct them in their exam, and said he was fully aware the two processes needed to be kept separate and any information sharing should only happen through formal channels.
	Lundie said he didn't recall if ""sanctions"" or ""Iran"" came up at the morning meeting.
	Under cross-examination, Lundie told defence lawyer Richard Peck that while the RCMP requested CBSA to bag Meng's cellphones, at the request of the FBI, he viewed that as a “reasonable” request because it was ""just to secure them.""
	Lundie also told Peck that that during Meng's CBSA exam, he recalled hearing a conversation in the doorway of the CBSA superintendent's office, where he and Mounties were waiting, between either Const. Yep or Const. Dhaliwal and a CBSA officer that mentioned ""passwords"" or ""passcodes.""
	He testified that he didn't speak up because he didn't understand the relevance, and didn't realize CBSA had obtained Meng's passcodes
	""I had no idea why there would be passwords to phones obtained by anybody,"" Lundie said, before admitting in retrospect, as a senior officer concerned about blurred lines between CBSA and RCMP roles, he should have spoken up.
	While Lundie testified he was tasked by RCMP higher-ups with acting as the contact at YVR for the FBI legal attaché the day of Meng's arrest, he testified he did not pass any information to the FBI ""that he shouldn't have.""
	He also told Peck that given his experience and position, he found being designated the FBI point-of-contact onsite put him in a ""very uncomfortable position.""

	Retired Staff Sgt. Ben Chang is the only witness in the Meng case to date who has declined to testify.
	Defence accuses Chang of illegally providing identifying information about Meng's electronic devices to the FBI, details they allege may have allowed U.S. investigators to access Meng's phone records and text messages.
	In an affidavit, Chang writes he was never specifically asked for the unique identifying numbers to Meng's devices from anyone at the FBI. Moreover, he writes, the information was never shared.
	His affidavit appears to be at least partially contradicted by an email from Chang to Dhaliwal that indicated the FBI legal attaché had requested ""descriptions and lists of the devices"" including the serial numbers.
	Chang maintains in his affidavit that he asked Dhaliwal to gather only ""basic information"" about Meng's devices, along with photos, because he believed U.S. authorities would need it to make a formal request for the devices through a process known as the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).
	According to the Globe & Mail newspaper, Chang now works as a senior security executive at a hotel and casino in Macau, which, like Hong Kong, is a special administrative region of China.
	Lawyers for Canada's Attorney General, according to documents filed with B.C. Supreme Court, have previously raised concerns around Chang related to ""witness safety.""
	The reference, first reported by the South China Morning Post, deals with a concern related to releasing notes from a 2019 phone call between Chang and a Department of Justice official.
	It's unclear if ""witness safety"" has any bearing on Chang's decision to not testify.
	When CTV News reached Chang's personal lawyer, Joe Saulnier, of Vancouver-based Martland & Saulnier, Saulnier said Chang had no comment.
	Meng's defence lawyers said Chang's refusal to testify may have ""any number of consequences"" and plan to incorporate it into their abuse of process arguments.

	Officer Katragadda was the least experienced member of the CBSA who dealt with Meng the day of her arrest, but also the officer who had the greatest amount of interaction with her.
	Katragadda, who joined the CBSA in 2015, testified he first learned about Meng at the Dec. 1 morning meeting at YVR with RCMP, where he said Mounties provided the arrest warrant.
	He also testified that, while he was not familiar with the name ""Meng Wanzhou,"" he had been previously aware that Huawei was suspect of assisting the Chinese government with spying.
	Katragadda testified he had admissibility concerns related to both serious criminality and national security.
	He said he did additional ""open source"" searching before Meng landed, which he said made him aware of the serious, high-profile nature of the matter, and that he could later be going to court.
	At the morning meeting with RCMP, Katragadda testified, he suggested CBSA conduct its exam of Meng first, before handing her off to the RCMP, but testified he couldn't recall who made the final decision.
	He testified he did not think the RCMP plan to arrest Meng on the plan was ""appropriate"" because he did not believe Meng posed an ""immediate risk.""
	Katragadda described Meng as a ""very pleasant person"" during their first interaction at the gate, where he identified her and asked her for her phones.
	He and Officer Scott Kirkland, who notes and surveillance video show, was chiefly assisting and taking notes, eventually escorted Meng to secondary inspection.
	Katragadda asked Meng some basic questions about her travels, searched her luggage, and X-rayed some boxes of household goods.
	Katragadda tesitified he was careful with his questions because he didn't want to be perceived to be asking Meng information on behalf of the RCMP or U.S. authorities.
	After less than an hour, Katragadda said, he had received enough information to adjourn the exam to a later date, and because he was mindful the RCMP were waiting to arrest Meng.
	But when he went to his supervisors' office, where he said Mounties were waiting, one of the CBSA supervisors on duty told Katragadda to hold off until they heard back from the CBSA National Security Unit.
	Katragadda testified that decision was ""not inappropriate"" but ""not what (he) had in mind.""
	The wait on a Saturday for two sets of additional questions from the unit, one of which dealt with countries Meng had travelled to, extended Meng's exam time to two hours and 36 minutes.
	In the final minutes before RCMP arrested Meng, Katragadda testified that he radioed Kirkland from the CBSA supervisors' office to ask Kirkland to obtain the passcodes to Meng's two phones.
	Katragadda testified that while he was the one who made the request, which he called ""reasonable,"" he could not recall whose idea it was.
	Less than 10 minutes later, notes and affidavits submitted by Katragadda and Kirkland show, RCMP arrested Meng.
	Katragadda testified he did not realize Meng's passcodes had been given to Mounties in error until ""days later"" at a debrief with CBSA higher-ups.

	Officer Kirkland, who has been with the CBSA since 2008, testified that he had serious concerns in the Dec. 1 morning meeting with RCMP about possible Charter issues being raised if CBSA were to examine Meng first.
	He also explained that, at a Port of Entry, there is a lower expectation of privacy which allows border officers to ask questions and conduct searches for immigration and customs purposes.
	""Our examination (could) be argued as a delay in due process,"" Kirkland testified.
	Under cross-examination, Kirkland later clarified to Meng defence lawyer Mona Duckett that while he suggested at the morning meeting that CBSA identify Meng and ""step aside,"" he did not raise his Charter concerns.
	Calling the meeting ad-hoc without ""any serious in-depth conversations,"" he testified that RCMP did not object to CBSA going first, and did not give CBSA any direction on how to conduct its exam.
	""This was a rushed discussion,"" Kirkland said.
	Kirkland also testified that when he read the warrant and some news articles about Huawei that morning, he was shocked.
	""We knew this was going to be a big deal,"" Kirkland said. ""It was going to be a huge issue.""
	When Meng arrived just after 11 a.m. and handed over her phones, Kirkland was tasked with putting them in mylar bags, which he said he kept in his cargo pants' pocket.
	He later testified he didn't believe the bags, which had been provided by RCMP on behalf of the FBI, were effective at blocking signal transmission, because at one point, he said, the phones were vibrating.
	During the exam itself, Kirkland admitted to Duckett he intentionally did not answer Meng's repeated questions about why she was being examined in-depth, and deliberately did not mention the arrest warrant or U.S. criminal charges.
	He also reminded Duckett, multiple times, that Katragadda, as lead examiner, was in charge of questioning Meng along with deciding when to end the exam.
	Kirkland later conceded to Duckett she was correct when she suggested the exam did not raise ""an iota of evidence to support a national security concern"" when it came to Meng.
	When it came to the passcodes to Meng's phones, Kirkland testified that he typically wrote passenger passcodes down both in his notebook and a loose sheet of paper, which he said he eventually returns to the traveller.
	Kirkland's testimony directly contradicted Const. Dhillon's, who testified that Kirkland handed him the sheet with Meng's passcodes. Instead, Kirkland testified he left the sheet with Meng's belongings at the counter, and when he realized he had left it behind, he went back to look for it.
	Kirkland testified that RCMP obtained Meng's passcodes by mistake, and he never intended, nor was he directed by anyone to provide them to Mounties.

CBSA Acting Supt. Sanjit Dhillon testifies in B.C. Supreme Court in November 2020 (Sketch by Jane Wolsak)
	Supt. Dhillon testified that he ""suggested"" to RCMP in the Dec. 1 morning meeting, along with CBSA Supt. Bryce McRae, that Mounties would not be able to intercept and arrest Meng at the gate.
	He testified that CBSA conduct its admissibility exam first, though. like his colleagues did not recall who made the final decision, saying ""that's how (he'd) been trained to do it.""
	Dhillon said at some point after the meeting, he spent roughly five to 10 minutes on the Huawei Wikipedia page, zeroing in on the section on ""controversies.""
	He testified he wondered ""if the fraud charges (against Meng) were related to any violations of sanctions.""
	He also said the article, which he later conceded under cross-examination by Mona Duckett could have been edited by anyone, raised concerns about national security and spying.
	Dhillon, who joined the agency in 2005, testified that he was the CBSA supervisor who relayed questions from the CBSA National Security Unit to one of the examining officers.
	Near the end of Meng's exam, Dhillon said he left the supervisors' office and approached the counter, where he began questioning Meng directly.
	He rejected accusations he was trying to gather evidence for the FBI, and instead stated he had national security concerns.
	Based on his Wikipedia research, Dhillon testified, he asked Meng if her company ""sold products in countries that they should not"" and specifically if Huawei ""sold products or did business in Iran.""
	He testified that based on Meng's ""non-verbal behavior...there's more to that story I was never able to explore.""
	Dhillon said he made no mention to Meng of the extradition warrant or U.S. fraud charges (which dealt with Huawei's business in Iran) because, he testified, he ""wanted (Meng) to speak to it.""
	He also admitted he did not tell Meng that RCMP were waiting to arrest her.
	During her cross-examination, Duckett accused Dhillon of lying on the stand and making up his Wikipedia research as a cover story in order to ask Meng about Iran, instead alleging he learned was told about Iran by RCMP during the morning meeting.
	Duckett called the research a ""creation after the fact"" and asked why Dhillon had singled out Iran, but not other countries mentioned on the Wikipedia page including North Korea, Venezuela, and Syria.
	Dhillon categorically rejected Duckett's accusations.
	He also testified that the RCMP did not ""instruct (him) to do anything that day.""

CBSA Supt. Bryce McRae testifies in B.C. Supreme Court in November 2020 (Sketch by Jane Wolsak)
	Supt. McRae testified he first became aware of the Meng case on Nov. 30, when the CBSA got a call, which emails filed in court show was from FBI legal attaché Sherri Onks.
	Onks wanted a contact number for the supervisor on duty the next day, McRae later wrote in a 2019 email to Crown, because a ""notable client"" would be arriving.
	While McRae was on duty at YVR on Dec. 1, he testified he was ""not a direct player"" into how events unfolded and decisions were made.
	McRae said he recalled little about the morning meeting with RCMP, and testified he did not remember Officer Kirkland suggesting CBSA could quickly identify Meng, then hand her off to the RCMP to be arrested.
	Defence lawyer Mona Duckett accused him of having a ""poor memory.""
	With respect to CBSA's questioning of Meng, McRae testified he couldn't remember if he provided advice to Officer Katragadda on when to end the exam.
	McRae also testified he did not discipline Officer Kirkland for his mistake in providing Meng's passcodes to the RCMP.

              Brazil's Bolsonaro rejects COVID-19 shot, calls masks taboo
          
","
              Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he won't take any working COVID-19 vaccine himself and calls the use of masks to limit the spread of the disease 'the last taboo to fall.'
        ","
                  Friday, Nov. 27, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/brazil-s-bolsonaro-rejects-covid-19-shot-calls-masks-taboo-1.5207303,"SAO PAULO  -- 
	Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he won't take any working COVID-19 vaccine himself and calls the use of masks to limit the spread of the disease ""the last taboo to fall.""
	Bolsonaro's comments, broadcast on his social media channels Thursday night, alarmed health experts who said they could undermine efforts to achieve vaccination levels essential to halting the pandemic and might scare off vaccine makers negotiating with local authorities.
	Bolsonaro also said, however, that any shot that is certified by Brazil's health agency will be available for free to the public.
	The Brazilian president, who contracted the virus in July, has long resisted the advice of most scientists and health experts to restrict social and economic activity, arguing that damage from a lockdown would be worse than the pandemic.
	He also repeatedly promoted an anti-malarial drug as the cure for the disease despite scientific studies finding it ineffective and possibly dangerous, and criticized state governors testing a Chinese shot at home.
	""I tell you; I will not take (any vaccine). It is my right and I am sure that Congress will not create difficulties for whoever doesn't want to take a vaccine,"" he said.
	""If it is effective, lasting, reliable, whoever doesn't take it will be doing harm only to himself, and who takes the vaccine will not be infected. There's nothing to worry about,"" Bolsonaro said.
	A study published July 15 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that social distancing measures can safely be halted if at least 75% of the population gets a vaccine that is more than 70% effective. Tests have shown some vaccine candidates have a potential efficacy higher than that.
	""Bolsonaro's statements are a horrible sign,"" said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil's Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials.
	""If he were a less popular president, this might have little effect, but he is the hero of a lot of people,"" Lago told The Associated Press.
	""His hardcore supporters might not get a shot and that will generate more political dispute on the right not to get vaccinated. That will make it harder for Brazil to get above that minimum level of 70, 75% of the population vaccinated, which is key for life to go back to some kind of normal.""
	Some sensitive groups, such as cancer patients and pregnant women, may not be able to take COVID-19 vaccines and will still be susceptible to the virus.
	More than 171,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Brazil, second only to the United States.
	""Forcing people to take the vaccine or say that who doesn't take it cannot get a passport, have a public job, that's dictatorship,"" the Brazilian president said. ""Whoever defends that is a dictator. Or a false dictator that is willing to do business with the lives of others.""
	Brazil's federal government has a deal to get up to 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate if it works. Other developers, such as Pfizer, are reportedly offering deals to Bolsonaro's administration. Sao Paulo state, the epicenter of the crisis in Brazil, has an agreement to buy a vaccine made by Chinese company Sinovac, which is in the final phase of testing.
	Bolsonaro also cast doubt on the use of masks to halt the spread despite the fact most health experts, including Lago, say numerous studies since the pandemic began have found them to be effective.
	""The matter of the masks, there will be a serious study sometime to talk about the effectiveness of the mask,"" Bolsonaro said. ""It is the last taboo to fall.""
	At the beginning of the pandemic, Bolsonaro often ventured out of Brazil's presidential palace unmasked to greet supporters, which he did less frequently after contracting the virus himself."

	TikTok's deadline to finalize a U.S. buyer has been extended for the second time in less than a month.
	The Trump administration on Wednesday gave the short-form video app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, until December 4 to conclude a proposed takeover deal by Oracle and Walmart, according to a spokesperson for the Treasury department.
	""The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has granted ByteDance a one-week extension...to allow time to review a revised submission that the Committee recently received,"" the spokesperson said.
	In an executive order this summer, Trump set November 12 as the hard deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok, which has more than 100 million users in the United States. But as the deadline came and went, confusion reigned over what consequences might be in store for TikTok. Trump's executive order did not say that TikTok would be banned if it missed the deadline; in fact, it outlines no consequences at all.
	Earlier this month, the U.S. government quietly extended that deadline by two weeks to this Friday, November 27, and has now kicked the can further down the road.
	TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
	Trump has labelled TikTok a danger to national security — a claim the company has denied and cybersecurity experts doubt — he issued another executive order in August that would have made it illegal to have any business dealings with the company.
	The U.S. Commerce Department tried to enforce that order by attempting to ban downloads of the app in September. The agency also said that by mid-November, internet companies would be banned from carrying TikTok's traffic.
	Both of those measures have been temporarily blocked by federal judges after TikTok and TikTok content creators sued in separate cases to prevent them from going into effect.
	ByteDance's proposed solution to the order, the deal with Walmart and Oracle, would see TikTok reorganized as a new, global company headquartered in the United States, with US investors accounting for a majority of the new company's ownership.
	Trump tentatively approved that deal in September when it was announced. But the arrangement has yet to be finalized by the U.S. government. (It would also still need to be greenlit by Chinese regulators.)
	For now, until next Friday, TikTok users will still be able to access the app while the Trump administration's ban remains suspended due to litigation."

              Black Friday lines form overnight in Montreal despite COVID-19 pandemic
          
","
              Poor weather and, more significantly, the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did not stop shoppers looking for Black Friday deals in Montreal from lining up in the cold overnight.

	There's an ongoing pandemic, Montreal is in the red zone and gatherings are not permitted, but that hasn't stopped shoppers from lining up overnight to get a deal on some sneakers on Black Friday.
	Lured perhaps by a pair of Air Jordan Max 1s for $40 or the Adidas x Pharrell ""Chinese New Year"" size 11s for $7, around people were camped on Ste. Catherine St. in front of Centrall MTL's flagship shoe store overnight.
	The queue formed Thursday night around 11 p.m. and grew to dozens by 4 a.m. Friday morning, the line up was around the block. Those in line were not spaced two metres apart though they were wearing masks.
	Julian Grau-brown was second in line after his friend showed up Thursday at 1 p.m. to get in line. His reason for braving the weather and pandemic is clear: he loves sneakers.
	""Every time I buy new sneakers, it's a new story,"" said Grau-brown. ""A new story means a new chapter in my life, and there's just so many beautiful things you can do with a shoe; whether you want to wear them, buy them, trade them and sell them. It's just a really evolving business in Montreal.""
A post shared by Centrall Montreal (@centrall.mtl)
	Retail analysts say the majority of this year's Black Friday purchases will likely be made online, but some, like the crowd in Montreal, will still hit up brick-and-mortar shops.
	Walmart, a typical target of the deal-hungry masses, has an extensive online sale that ends Sunday night, and Apple has combined its Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals into one weekend-long online shop-fest.
	Montreal police (SPVM) patrols will be monitoring retail stores where lines are known to form to ensure masks are being worn and people are spaced two metres apart.
	""There are not more police officers, they're just going to patrol around the sectors where they know there are possibly line ups,"" said SPVM spokesperson Jean-Pierre Brabant. ""If we see people without masks, we'll advise them to wear them... We're not going to give tickets, we're just going to advise them.""
	Brabant said if people don't comply with officers' requests, fines may be given. "

	A subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma, according to a person familiar with a Justice Department tax investigation of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden's son.
	The breadth of the subpoena, issued Tuesday, underscores the wide-angle lens prosecutors are taking as they examine the younger Biden's finances and international business ventures.
	Hunter Biden's ties to Burisma in particular have long dogged the policy work and political aspirations of his father, Joe Biden, now the president-elect of the United States. It's unclear whether Hunter Biden's work at the Ukrainian company is a central part of the federal investigation or whether prosecutors are simply seeking information about all his sources of income in recent years.
	The person was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	A lawyer for the younger Biden, George Mesires, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment for this story and a spokesman for the Biden transition team declined to comment.
	Hunter Biden confirmed Wednesday that his taxes are under federal investigation. The revelation comes at a delicate time for the president-elect, who is building out his Cabinet and will soon decide on his nominee to run the Justice Department, the same department overseeing the investigation into his son.
	In addition to the Burisma-related request, the subpoena issued last week also seeks information on Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other financial transactions.
	The probe was launched in 2018, the year before his father announced his candidacy for president. At one point in the investigation, federal prosecutors were also examining potential money laundering offences, two people familiar with the matter told the AP.
	Hunter Biden said he only learned of the investigation on Tuesday.
	The younger Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then vice-president, was helping conduct the Obama administration's foreign policy with Ukraine. President Donald Trump and his allies have long argued, without evidence, that Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine influenced the Obama administration's policies toward the Eastern European nation.
	Senate Republicans said in a report earlier this year that the appointment may have posed a conflict of interest but did not provide evidence that any policies were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	The president-elect is not believed to be a focus of the investigation. He has not weighed in on the merits of the investigation, saying only to reporters on Friday that he was ""proud of my son.""
	For months, the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh has also been collecting information from Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and others as part of the Justice Department's process to receive and analyze information related to Ukraine, including documents Giuliani wanted to present to prosecutors that he had been gathering in Ukraine about Joe and Hunter Biden.
	In announcing that process in February, Barr cautioned that the department had to be careful about any information coming from Ukraine, saying: ""There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, a lot of cross currents. And we can't take anything we received from Ukraine at face value.""
	The former New York City mayor was a main character when the House voted to impeach Trump. The impeachment inquiry centred on Trump's dealings with Ukraine's president and whether he abused his office by seeking the investigation into the Bidens. Giuliani pressured officials to do the investigations and has been pushing unsubstantiated corruption allegations against the Bidens.
	Giuliani himself had also been under federal investigation, with federal prosecutors in Manhattan examining whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the matter. It was unclear whether that investigation remains active as Trump has discussed the possibility of preemptive pardons for some of his family members and close associates, including Giuliani."

	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.
	Pence also tweeted about Lai, saying the charges against him are ""an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere."""

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world. 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was “alarmed” that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the People’s Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canada’s arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	“Our government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,” said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	“It was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence … because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,” Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in “hostage diplomacy” and that the Chinese government back then “is completely different to the Chinese government today.”
	Conservative leader Erin O’Toole called the joint training exercise a “dangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.”
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	China’s President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending China’s interests.
	Meng’s arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department’s efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	“We will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,” Sajjan said.

	India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.
	Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the six-month standoff between the two countries' armies ""has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in the status along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.""
	Srivastava was responding to a statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in Beijing on Thursday that ""the rights and wrongs of what has happened in the China-India border area are very clear and the responsibility lies squarely with the Indian side.""
	Hua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. ""We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,"" she said.
	The standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.
	The countries have held a series of talks on ending the standoff without any breakthrough."

Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistant

              U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.

	U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.
	Bloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.
	It quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau ""according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.""
	China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.
	Bloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.
	It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.
	""We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,"" a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
	Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.
	China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.
	China this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.
	Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials."

	China's sales of SUVs, minivans and sedans rose by double digits in November as the country recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, but were below pre-virus levels for the year, an industry group reported Friday.
	Sales in the industry's biggest global market rose 11.6% over a year earlier to 2.3 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 12.6% to 2.8 million, holding steady at October's growth rate.
	From January to November, passenger vehicle sales were off 7.6% from the same period of 2019, at 17.8 million. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 20.6% to 4.7 million.
	Full-year auto sales are on track to decline for a third year after hitting a peak in 2017.
	China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first country to reopen its economy after the disease was declared under control in March.
	November sales of all-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled, rising 104.9% over a year earlier. Sales in the first 11 months of 2020 edged back above pre-virus levels, rising 3.9% over a year earlier.
	Auto demand already was weak before China closed factories and dealerships in February to fight the coronavirus. Consumers are uneasy about slowing economic growth and a tariff war with Washington.
	That hurts global automakers that are looking to China to propel sales growth and are spending heavily to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet Chinese government sales quotas."

Chinese man extradited from Malaysia to U.S. over turtle-smuggling ring worth millions

A Chinese citizen who allegedly financed a turtle-trafficking ring has been extradited from Malaysia to the United States, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in a statement on Thursday.
	Kang Juntao, 24, from Hangzhou in eastern China, was initially charged with money laundering last February. Between June 2017 and December 2018, he allegedly financed a nationwide ring of people who purchased turtles in the U.S. belonging to five protected species, and arranged for them to be illegally shipped to Hong Kong.
	""The turtles were inhumanely bound with duct tape and placed in socks so as not to alert customs authorities,"" the DOJ statement said.
	According to Kang's indictment, at least 1,500 turtles -- with a total value of US$2,250,000 -- were smuggled out of the U.S.
	Using a PayPal account, Kang allegedly purchased turtles from sellers advertising on social media or reptile trade websites.
	These sellers allegedly shipped the turtles to ""middlemen"" who were ""typically Chinese citizens who entered the country on student visas,"" according to the DOJ. Kang allegedly paid and instructed them to repackage the turtles, and use false labels for shipment to Hong Kong.
	Once in Hong Kong, the turtles were allegedly sold on the black market for thousands of dollars each.
	Kang allegedly did not declare the turtles to U.S. or Chinese customs, or obtain required permits from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
	Authorities allege Kang trafficked the eastern box turtle, the Florida box turtle, the Gulf Coast box turtle, the spotted turtle, and the wood turtle -- all protected species under the CITES treaty.
	Kang was arrested at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport last January before his extradition to the U.S. on Thursday.
	""Wildlife trafficking is a serious crime that impacts imperiled species at home and abroad,"" said Aurelia Skipwith, director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, in the DOJ statement."

              Bahrain plans free shots, Saudi Arabia approves Pfizer vaccine

              Bahrain has announced plans to give the public free coronavirus vaccines, as Saudi Arabia said it approved an inoculation by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to fight the pandemic.

	Bahrain has announced plans to give the public free coronavirus vaccines, as Saudi Arabia said it approved an inoculation by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to fight the pandemic.
	The island nation of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, made the vaccine pledge in an announcement published late Thursday by its state-run Bahrain News Agency.
	""A safe vaccine will be provided free of charge to all citizens and residents within the kingdom,"" the statement said, without elaborating on which vaccine it would offer.
	Bahrain plans to inoculate everyone 18 years and older in the kingdom at 27 different medical facilities, hoping to be able to vaccinate 10,000 people a day. Bahrain, an island in the Persian Gulf home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, has a population of around 1.5 million people.
	A week ago, Bahrain said it had become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine after the United Kingdom.
	The Pfizer shots, a so-called ""mRNA vaccine,"" contain a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. To be vaccinated, a person receives two shots over 21 days.
	In the time since, Bahrain has not responded to questions from The Associated Press, including on Friday. Pfizer told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the ""timing of delivery and the volume of doses,"" were confidential and declined to comment.
	Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculated some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine is an ""inactivated"" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it.
	The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday described the Sinopharm vaccine as 86 per cent effective, but provided few details and answered no questions. It marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of that shot.
	Earlier Thursday, Saudi Arabia's Food and Drug Authority said it had registered the Pfizer vaccine ""so that health authorities in the kingdom can then import and use the vaccine.""
	The kingdom said it based its decision on information given by Pfizer on Nov. 24, without elaborating. Pfizer on Nov. 18 said its vaccine is 95 per cent effective.
	A major challenge for the Pfizer shot in the Mideast remains the weather, however. The vaccines must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
	Saudi Arabia said its Health Ministry later would announce plans on how it would distribute the vaccine in the kingdom, the biggest Gulf Arab state, with a population of 34 million people.
	Egypt received its first shipment of the Sinopharm vaccine on Thursday via the United Arab Emirates."

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's historically challenging transition to power is suddenly becoming even more complicated.
	A federal investigation into the finances of Biden's son Hunter threatens to embolden congressional Republicans, who have already shown little willingness to work with the incoming president or even acknowledge his clear victory in last month's election. For sure, it will complicate Senate confirmation hearings for Biden's yet-to-be-named attorney general, who could ultimately have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son.
	It all raises the prospect of even deeper dysfunction in a capital that is already struggling to address the nation's most pressing crises, including a surging pandemic whose daily death tolls are beginning to surpass the devastation of the Sept. 11 attacks. Republicans, particularly those eyeing presidential runs in 2024, are making clear they will press Biden on the issue.
	""Joe Biden needs to pledge today that he will co-operate with the federal investigation and answer any questions under oath,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Thursday, ""and that if he is sworn in as president, no federal investigator or attorney working on the Hunter Biden criminal case will be removed.""
	Hunter Biden has long been a source of worry for his father's campaign and was the subject of repeated unsupported accusations by President Donald Trump and his allies. But news of the probe, which was revealed on Wednesday and scrutinizes some of Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other transactions, caught most of his father's staffers by surprise.
	The president-elect had no public appearance Thursday as he moved forward with filling out his administration. But the investigation threatens to destabilize a transition that has prioritized a methodical rollout of Cabinet selections, White House hires and policy goals -- all meant to guarantee momentum when Biden takes office and immediately has to grapple with a surging pandemic and shaky economy.
	Most notably, the probe casts a spotlight on one of Biden's most important choices: his attorney general.
	Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland have emerged as the leading contenders, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press this week. But dynamics could shift, as any Biden choice now will be scrutinized for any perceived loyalty to the president-elect and bias in any probe of his son.
	Both Garland and especially Jones have longtime ties to Biden.
	The president-elect himself is not a subject of the investigation. And Biden aides believe that because other Hunter Biden stories have blown over, this will, too. They note that a tax fraud investigation pales in comparison to Trump's refusal to concede the election or to the pandemic that has killed more than 290,000 Americans.
	Biden is expected to announce more Cabinet picks, but not attorney general, on Friday.
	Trump's initial public response was surprisingly muted, just a pair of tweets about a Fox News segment on the story Wednesday night. But privately, he demanded to know why the investigation was not revealed ahead of Election Day, accusing officials of deliberately stalling in order to help Biden's chances, according to two Republicans familiar with the conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.
	Other Republicans, including possible presidential contenders, were anything but shy in piling on.
	""If there were ever circumstances that created a conflict of interest and called for a special counsel, I think those circumstances are present here,"" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Thursday. ""The Biden family has been trading on Joe Biden's public office for 50 years. Do we really think that that will change if Joe Biden becomes president, the highest office in the land?""
	Some of Trump's children have also faced some legal questions.
	Donald Trump Jr. was scrutinized in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe for the 2016 meeting he had with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. And Ivanka Trump was recently deposed by investigators from the District of Columbia attorney general's office as part of its lawsuit alleging the misuse of inaugural funds.
	The Hunter Biden investigation is the latest in a series of politically charged inquiries that the Justice Department has grappled with in the past five years, following probes into Hillary Clinton's email use and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
	Regardless of the facts of the investigation, a new Justice Department will likely feel compelled to assert its independence from the White House following allegations that its actions were overly politicized during the Trump administration. Biden has said he will play no role in department investigative decisions.
	""There are plenty of people that are going to have their hands in this one, but I think it's really going to be driven by the new administration's push to have total independence on any investigation,"" said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Weinstein, a New Jersey defence lawyer.
	""I think that's going to be paramount,"" he added. ""They are going to bend over backwards to make sure that they do the contrary to the current administration -- which is independence, let the investigation takes its course.""
	In this case, though, there is no perfect outcome for Biden.
	A protracted criminal investigation that results in an indictment would be a major distraction and then some as the new president tries to implement his agenda. But if the Justice Department decides against bringing charges, officials will feel pressure to explain their steps and reassure the American public the inquiry was done in a competent and thorough way.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including to Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe.
	The federal investigation, centring on potential tax crimes, had been going on at least a year before Biden announced his candidacy. Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to voting because of a department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts.
	Biden, fiercely protective of his own family, was said to be, in a statement released by his transition, ""deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	Biden struck a similarly defiant tone throughout the campaign whenever questions emerged about his son, which they frequently did. When Trump assailed Hunter Biden as a drug user during the first presidential debate in Cleveland, his father acknowledged that Hunter had had past substance abuse issues but added, ""He's worked on it. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.""
	The spotlight on Hunter Biden intensified in the election's final weeks, after Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed unsubstantiated claims about his foreign business dealings. Those were based in part on New York Post reporting on a laptop that supposedly once belonged to Hunter Biden and was abandoned at a Delaware repair shop.
	Hunter Biden had joined the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then the vice-president, was helping conduct Obama administration foreign policy with Ukraine. But, in a subsequent report, Senate Republicans did not produce any evidence that the hiring influenced U.S. policies.
	Joe Biden largely refused to even acknowledge the laptop controversy. His son, meanwhile, kept almost completely out of the public eye during the nearly 18 months his father was running for president.
	One of the few times he was seen was on stage outside the convention centre in Wilmington, Delaware, as his father was surrounded by joyous family members following his speech declaring victory in the presidential election. Hunter Biden, and his baby son, were right in the middle.

              'None of us imagined this': Michael Kovrig's wife marks two-year anniversary of his detention

	On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrig’s imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.
	""Here we are, two years later, still speaking about him being in detention. None of us would have imagined this was going to be the case,"" said Vina Nadjibulla in an interview on CTV’s Power Play on Thursday.
	""I hoped sincerely that Michael would be home by now and instead he’s facing a prospect of his third Christmas alone, in isolation, in detention.""
	Kovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested in China on Dec. 10, 2018, and charged with allegations of state spying for Canada. The Canadian government calls their detention arbitrary, while most in the diplomatic community view it as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days prior in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request.
	Consular access has been limited throughout the pandemic; the two men went 10 months without communication with Canadian representatives.
	""Our contact has been very limited between January and October. There were no consular visits, there were very few letters from Michael. Finally, in October we were able to get a consular visit and at least confirmation and a reassurance that he is still healthy and is doing well,"" said Nadjibulla, who is married to Kovrig but separated.
	Canada’s Ambassador to China Dominic Barton who is leading the effort to secure Kovrig and Spavor’s release, told a House of Commons committee this week that the two men looked ""robust"" and that one ""would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Nadjibulla called that long-awaited visit this fall a ""huge relief"" but notes she remains deeply concerned about his mental health.
	""Michael is doing everything he possibly can to keep his mind occupied with positive thoughts, with virtuous thoughts, with prayers of gratitude, with philosophical passages. Reading really provides him solace day-to-day, he essentially says that is what gets him through moment-to-moment, is being able to read and have access to books, which we’ve been advocating for quite a bit,"" said Nadjibulla.
	The Liberal government remains adamant it’s doing all it can to free the men, despite opposition criticism that Ottawa has been ""kowtowing"" to China over the last several years.
	""Today is the sad anniversary of the illegal abduction and imprisonment of two innocent Canadians in China,"" said Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole during a press conference on Thursday.
	""For months China has unfairly targeted our farming exports. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out mass internment of the Uighurs in concentration camps and still the Liberals keep pushing for more involvement and more engagement with China.""
	Optimism sparked last week when the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Justice Department was in talks with Meng’s legal team to resolve her fraud charges and allow her to return home should she admit to criminal wrongdoing. It led to speculation that the arrangement could pave a way for Kovrig and Spavor’s freedom.
	Nadjibulla says, more broadly, she was left hopeful after hearing that during the first call between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden the leaders discussed the fate of the two men.
	""I pray that we will be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.

	Politicians from various Western countries have asked consumers to buy Australian wine in order to fight back against China's punitive tariffs on the beverage.
	China is the most important export market for Australian wine, and winemakers are scrambling to find new markets following Beijing's decision to slap tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine imports amid an escalating trade war between the two nations.
	Now a number of public figures associated with the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which calls itself ""an international cross-party group of legislators working to reform the approach of democratic countries to China,"" have called on consumers to stand up to Beijing.
	""We are asking you all to join us in standing against Xi Jinping's authoritarian bullying,"" said Miriam Lexmann, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) representing the Christian Democrats, in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday.
	""By drinking a bottle or two of Australian wine and letting the Chinese Communist Party know that we will not be bullied,"" added Elisabet Lann, a municipal councilor from Sweden's Christian Democrats.
	Other politicians featured in the video include Australian MP Kimberley Kitching, US Senator Ted Yoho and Shiori Yamao, an independent member of Japan's House of Representatives.
	Tony Battaglene, CEO of Australian Grape and Wine, a national association, said Beijing's tariffs have endangered business with mainland China.
	Battaglene works with around 800 wine producers in Australia who have ""built their businesses"" around exporting to China and are now left with no backup plan, he added.
	""We were surprised, we were shocked,"" Battaglene told CNN Business. ""Having the extent of these interim tariffs, I mean essentially they will close the market to Australian bottled wine, to premium wine, in China. There's no way that we can compete at those levels.""
	China's Commerce Ministry announced Friday that its decision was made after finding preliminary evidence of dumping. Australian officials have bitterly protested the move, saying that China has been unable to provide proof.
	The wine war is taking place against the backdrop of a wider deterioration in relations. Australia has upset China this year by calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing later targeted Canberra over trade, namely by suspending some imports of beef and slapping heavy tariffs on barley."

              'Two Michaels' mark two jailed years in China, no development in their cases

	In his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.
	As much as that matters, Kovrig's wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival.
	She says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.
	Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.
	Canada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they've endured their captivity was inspiring.
	""Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, and their families, have shown truly remarkable perseverance in the face of an unimaginable situation,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.
	Kovrig is ""marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength"" to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week.
	""He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,"" she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.
	""He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.""
	A statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.
	The statement said that ""contrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.""
	The statement also said that ""the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.""
	The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor's friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.
	Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada's diplomatic corps, a career-focused on preventing deadly conflicts.
	""He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,"" said Nadjibulla.
	She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy's ""War and Peace,"" to Nelson Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom."" He's reread one of his pre-prison favourites, ""Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.
	""It essentially posits that it's important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it's very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,"" she said.
	Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of ""fear into prudence, pain into information,"" said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added ""anger into determination and grievance into resolve"" to that philosophy.
	He has been drawn to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, ""which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,"" said Nadjibulla.
	Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.
	Robert Malley, Kovrig's boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They're also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.
	Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig's discipline.
	""None of us can be prepared for that, unless you're in the military and you're told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,"" said Malley.
	When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.
	Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton's on-site virtual visit in October -- his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn't allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.
	He was shocked at the pandemic's scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie ""Contagion.""
	Kovrig is also aware that he is one of ""two Michaels"" and understands that both he and Spavor ""are caught in this bigger situation,"" she said. It's not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.
	Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department's attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.
	If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.
	""Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,"" Nadjibulla said. ""They're pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.""

              China restricts U.S. official travel to Hong Kong

              China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.

	China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	U.S. diplomatic passport holders visiting Hong Kong and nearby Macao will temporarily no longer receive visa-free entry privileges, spokesperson Hua Chunying said.
	U.S. administration officials, congressional staffers, employees of non-governmental organizations and their immediate family members will face ""reciprocal sanctions,"" Hua said.
	She was apparently referring to U.S. sanctions that bar certain Chinese and Hong Kong officials from travelling to the U.S. or having dealings with the U.S. financial system over their roles in imposing a sweeping National Security Law passed this summer that ushered in a crackdown on free speech and opposition political activity in Hong Kong.
	Hua said the move was taken ""given that the U.S. side is using the Hong Kong issue to seriously interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's core interests.""
	Those sanctioned ""have performed egregiously and are primarily responsible on the Hong Kong issue,"" she said at a daily briefing.
	""China once again urges the U.S. side to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and not go further down the wrong and dangerous path,"" Hua said.
	China had long threatened to retaliate against the U.S. sanctions and other actions seen as hostile.
	Earlier, China's official Xinhua News Agency said Trump administration officials are ""digging a hole"" for the next U.S. administration's relationship with China through actions targeting the country and its officials.
	Steps such as restricting visas for the 92 million members of the ruling Communist Party and their families have ""again exposed the sinister intentions of extreme anti-China forces in Washington to hijack China-U.S. relations for their own political gain,"" Xinhua said in an editorial.
	The U.S. State Department last week cut the duration of such visas from 10 years to one month, another example of the increasingly hard-line stance adopted by the administration in its waning days. That came in addition to the sanctions targeting specific Chinese and Hong Kong officials over their actions in Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has signalled he intends to keep pressure on China, he's also expected to seek a return to more conventional, less confrontational style of diplomacy. Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington's stance toward Beijing.
	""By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-U.S. relations on issues concerning China's core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration's relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains,"" Xinhua said.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.
	Dozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.
	On Wednesday, Pompeo accused U.S. universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was ""poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends.""
	Chinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying U.S. accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.
	Perhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.
	""Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation,"" Xinhua said. ""The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-U.S. relations."""

              Hunter Biden tax probe examining Chinese business dealings

	The Justice Department's investigation scrutinizing Hunter Biden's taxes has been examining some of his Chinese business dealings, among other financial transactions, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	The investigation was launched in 2018, a year before his father, Joe Biden, announced his candidacy for president, but it isn't clear which entities might be tied up in the probe, and the inquiry was not disclosed to Hunter Biden until Tuesday.
	The younger Biden has a history of international affairs and business dealings in a number of countries, and the revelation of a federal investigation puts a renewed spotlight on the questions about his financial dealings that dogged his father's successful White House campaign.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including one for Hunter Biden, according to another person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe. The tax investigation centres on his business dealings, the person said.
	Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to the election because of a Justice Department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts, one of the people said.
	In a statement released by the president-elect's transition office, Hunter Biden said he learned about the investigation on Tuesday, but he did not disclose specifics about what was being scrutinized.
	""I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,"" he said in a statement.
	He has long been a target of President Donald Trump and his allies, who have accused him of profiting off his political connections. Trump and his supporters also raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption related to Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine at the time his father was vice-president and leading the Obama administration's dealings with the Eastern European nation.
	Late Wednesday, Trump tweeted a quote from New York Post columnist Miranda Devine claiming, ""10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.""
			“10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.” Miranda Devine @nypost @TuckerCarlson But I won anyway!
	The disclosure of the federal investigation, led by the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware, comes at an awkward moment for the incoming president, who is assembling his Cabinet. His pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son if it is still ongoing when Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.
	The transition team said in a statement, ""President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	It could also add weight to Trump's broad accusations that Biden was weak on China. Trump took a tough line on China during the campaign as he tried to deflect blame for the coronavirus. Biden has rejected the characterization that he was weak and said, that unlike Trump, he would rebuild global coalitions to check China's power.
	A New Yorker profile on Hunter Biden last year detailed some of his business work in China, including how he accompanied his father on a 2013 trip to Beijing, where he met with a business associate. He also acknowledged having received a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon involved in liquified natural gas projects. He downplayed the idea that the gift could have been intended to affect his father's policy. He told the magazine that he gave the diamond to an associate.
	""What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn't in office,"" he said.
	Hunter Biden has been caught up in controversies before. While his father was vice-president, Hunter joined the Naval Reserve and was discharged after testing positive for cocaine in his system, later revealing a yearslong struggle with addiction.
	He also joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, sparking concerns about the perceptions of a conflict of interest given the elder Biden was deeply involved in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. An investigation by the Republican-led Senate did not identify any policies that were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	In the weeks before the election, Trump supporters used the existence of a laptop they said was connected to Hunter Biden -- and the emergence of someone who maintains he had business discussions with him -- to raise questions about Joe Biden's knowledge of his son's activities in Ukraine and China. The president-elect has said he did not discuss his son's international business dealings with him and has denied having ever taken money from a foreign country.
	The laptop surfaced publicly in October when The New York Post reported on emails that it said had come from Hunter Biden's laptop and that it said it received from Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer.
	A third person familiar with the matter said the tax investigation does not have anything to do with the laptop. Like the other people who spoke to the AP, the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
	In a CNN interview last week, President-elect Biden addressed the business dealings of his son Hunter and his brothers, pledging that they would avoid any perceived conflicts of interest during his time in office.
	""My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict, where there's appropriate distance from the presidency and government,"" Biden said.

	The EU's medicines regulator said Wednesday it had been the victim of a cyberattack, just weeks before it is due to decide on special approval for two coronavirus vaccines.
	The Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the incident was being investigated but did not say exactly when it took place or give details about what was targeted.
	""EMA has been the subject of a cyberattack. The agency has swiftly launched a full investigation, in close cooperation with law enforcement and other relevant entities,"" the EMA said in a brief statement.
	""EMA cannot provide additional details whilst the investigation is ongoing. Further information will be made available in due course.""
	A spokeswoman for the agency referred back to the statement when asked for more details by AFP.
	The EMA has said it will give a decision on conditional approval for Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine at a meeting that will be held by December 29 at the latest.
	A ruling on Moderna's version should follow by January 12.
	The regulator is also carrying out reviews of vaccines developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine and Johnson & Johnson.
	The EMA moved to Amsterdam from London after Britain left the European Union in January 2019. It oversees all medicines for the 27-nation EU.
SERIES OF WARNINGS
	The cyberattack on the EMA comes after a series of warnings about hacking related to the coronavirus pandemic.
	Britain accused Russian-based, Kremlin-linked hackers in July of targeting labs conducting coronavirus vaccine research.
	Cybercriminals have tried to attack several pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca and South Korean laboratories, according to the Wall Street Journal.
	Spanish laboratories also reportedly have been attacked by Chinese cybercriminals, the El Pais newspaper reported in September.
	Microsoft urged a crackdown in November on cyberattacks perpetrated by states and ""malign actors"" after a spate of hacks disrupted healthcare organisations fighting the virus.
	IBM said last week that it too had uncovered a string of attacks, again potentially carried out by state actors, against companies involved in the effort to distribute the vaccine.
	The European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union was one target of the attacks, as well as European and Asian companies involved in the supply chain, IBM said.
	Meanwhile, it is not the first time a Netherlands-based international body has been targeted by hackers.
	Dutch authorities expelled four alleged Russian intelligence agents in 2018 after an alleged bid to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, using equipment in the back of a car parked in a neighbouring hotel."

              Why did Mount Everest's height change?

              China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.

	The world's highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story.
	China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.
	As definitive as that sounds, geological changes, the complicated business of measuring a mountain and varying criteria for determining the world's highest peak will likely ensure the question isn't settled for good.
	The mountain's height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down.
	The countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest's height earlier this year.
	""Nature tends to strike a balance,"" he told the official Xinhua News Agency. As an example, Dang cited a massive 1934 earthquake that wiped out 150 years of steady height increase in a few moments.
	There's more than one way to measure a mountain.
	Last year, a Nepalese team set up a satellite navigation marker on Everest's peak to gauge its exact position via GPS satellites. A Chinese team undertook a similar mission this spring, though it used the Chinese-made Beidou constellation of navigation satellites, along with other equipment.
	At the same time, Nepalese crews took measurements with modern, laser-equipped versions of instruments called theodolites, first used to gauge the mountain's height in 1856 by measuring angles using trigonometry.
	The Nepalese team also used ground penetrating radar to measure the amount of snow and ice that sits on top of its highest rock.
	China and Nepal jointly presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 metres (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The two had diverged for years over the mountain's actual height.
	The new height is 0.86 metres (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries' two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The agreement announced Tuesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between them.
	Measuring the height above sea level has always been tricky because ocean levels vary considerably depending on tides, magnetism and other factors. Rising sea levels are creating another factor for future measurements.
	How high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain's height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills.
	As measured from the Earth's core, Ecuador's Mount Chimborazo is the world's highest, standing more than 2,072 metres (6,800 feet) above Everest. Because the Earth bulges in the middle, mountains along the equator are farther from the core.
	Measuring from the foot of the mountain to the peak, Hawaii's Mauna Kea is the tallest. Most of it, however, is under the sea.
	This story has been corrected to say that the agreement was announced Tuesday, not Wednesday.

	The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.
	The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.
	The UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.
	The UAE's Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they ""have reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""
	""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.
	It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.
	Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.
	The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.
	Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus' spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.
	Top officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.
	Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.
	In transport, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must remain at cold temperatures -- negative 70 degrees Celsius (negative 94 degree Fahrenheit) and negative 20 degrees Celsius (negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively.
	The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people in China had received its vaccine.
	Meanwhile Wednesday, Abu Dhabi announced it would resume ""all economic, tourism, cultural and entertainment activities in the emirate within two weeks."" It attributed the decision to ""successes"" in halting the spread of the coronavirus.
	Abu Dhabi has required those travelling into the emirate from the UAE's other six sheikhdoms to take a coronavirus test within 48 hours prior to arrival.
	Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over 9 million people.
	In Iran, meanwhile, President Hassan Rouhani angrily blamed U.S. sanctions for making it difficult for Tehran to purchase medicine and health supplies amid the pandemic.
	And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the first shipment of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, calling it a ""big day of celebration"" for the country.
	""I believe in this vaccine. I expect it will receive the appropriate approval in the coming days,"" Netanyahu said, adding that he intended to be the first to receive it. ""We see the end of the pandemic.""

              Kovrig, Spavor are 'inspiring' and 'robust' in Chinese prison, says Canada's envoy

              Canada's ambassador to China says Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are physically and mentally well and showing inspiring resilience as they near the end of their second year of imprisonment by the People's Republic.

	Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are physically and mentally well and showing inspiring resilience as they near the end of their second year of imprisonment by the People's Republic, says Canada's ambassador to China.
	Dominic Barton also says Chinese authorities were paranoid about containing the spread of COVID-19 as they denied consular access to the two men from January to October.
	""Our understanding of why it was the case is that the Chinese are completely paranoid about the virus,"" Barton said in testimony Tuesday night before the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations.
	Barton is leading Canada's efforts in China to win the release of Kovrig and Spavor, who were arrested and imprisoned on Dec. 10, 2018, in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou.
	After months of delay, Barton was most recently granted on-site virtual consular access to Kovrig and Spavor in November, following similar virtual visits with the two Canadians a month earlier.
	""We were obviously very frustrated at not being able to get access even virtually because as far as we know . . . the virus doesn't go through televisions,"" said Barton.
	The Chinese government has charged Kovrig and Spavor with espionage but the Canadian government says their detention is arbitrary and has called repeatedly for their release.
	Barton said it wasn't just Canada that was blocked by the Chinese from visiting prisoners charged in national security cases; the U.S. and Britain faced similar restrictions.
	When Barton was able to see them, he said he was able to verify they were in good physical and mental condition.
	""They are robust,"" said Barton, who was testifying from Beijing via video link. ""You would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Spavor is being held in a prison in the city of Dandong near the North Korean border while Kovrig is in a Beijing area prison.
	""It's a strange thing. We fly to these places, or drive to them in the case of Beijing. And I know that the Michaels (are) literally sort of on the other side of the wall, but you've got, you know, two big TVs,"" he said. ""It's like this.""
	Barton's main purpose for testifying was to describe the three-day Chinese government-controlled visit to Tibet that he and nine other Western diplomats undertook in October. He said he remains concerned about the human rights situation there and that they only saw what the Chinese wanted them to see.
	Even though the area is filled with security cameras, as is the capital of Beijing, Barton said he wandered off a couple of times to visit with locals without his Chinese government minders in tow.
	He said Canada is not reluctant to raise human rights concerns with China even though some people think Canada is in the Chinese ""doghouse"" these days. He also said that even though he knew the visit to Tibet would be controlled, it sent a signal to local people that the outside world still cared about their plight.
	Thursday marked Barton's second appearance before the committee this year, following testimony in February in which he declared ""the chill is real"" in Canadian relations with China.
	In February, Barton described an angry, emotional meeting during his first diplomatic contact with his Chinese counterparts after being appointed to the post in 2019 after a long career in business, which included being the global managing director of the consulting giant McKinsey & Co.
	His position in the company gave Barton high level access in China and across Asia, something the Trudeau government is hoping to leverage to win freedom for Kovrig and Spavor while maintaining economic relations with its second largest trading partner.

              Another judge blocks Trump's TikTok ban; app still in limbo
          
","
              A federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.

	A federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.
	The Trump administration had tried to ban the short-form video app from smartphone app stores in the U.S. and cut it off from vital technical services. TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.
	Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said in a ruling Monday that the Commerce Department ""likely overstepped"" its use of presidential emergency powers ""and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to consider obvious alternatives.""
	Nichols is the second federal judge to fully block the Trump administration's economic sanctions against the app as the court cases proceed.
	The Trump administration has alleged that TikTok is a security threat because the Chinese government could spy on app users' personal data. TikTok has denied it's a security threat but said it's still trying to work with the administration to resolve its concerns.
	Trump in September gave his tentative blessing to a proposal by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns by having the U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart invest in TikTok. Oracle would manage U.S. user data under the arrangement. But a federal agency still has to review and finalize an arrangement.
	A government deadline for ByteDance to complete the deal passed on Friday, and it's not clear what the status of the agreement is.
	The Treasury Department, which chairs the agency reviewing the deal, said Friday that the agency ""is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks arising from the transaction.""
	The Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, it's not clear what his administration will carry on the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to secure a ban, or increase the involvement of U.S. companies."

              The day soccer dyed: Chinese match off because 'hair not black enough'

	A women's university soccer match in China descended into farce and was eventually called off after players were told that they were not allowed to have dyed hair, state media said Tuesday.
	The incident trended on the Twitter-like Weibo, angering many people, and comes after the men's national team were ordered to cover up their tattoos.
	The latest high-profile example of the shrinking space for individualism in communist-ruled China came when the women's sides of Fuzhou and Jimei universities met in a college league match in the southeastern province of Fujian.
	The teams were reportedly warned about the ban on dyed hair beforehand but as they were getting ready for the match on November 30 officials spotted that players from both sides had failed to heed the reminder.
	At least one Fuzhou University player was then spotted frantically having her hair dyed again in an attempt to return it to its original colour, but it failed to dry in time, the Beijing News said.
	The newspaper, citing someone at the scene who gave the pseudonym Zhang Zhi, said that some Fuzhou players also ran off to a nearby hair salon to buy black hair dye.
	However, one Fuzhou player was deemed ineligible because her hair was ""still not black enough"" so they were unable to field enough players, consequently forfeiting the match 3-0, the report said.
	Fuzhou University declined to comment when contacted by AFP. However, the China News cited the university as saying that the ban on dyed hair was ""in accordance with relevant regulations"" passed down from the education ministry in Beijing.
	""The relevant documents stipulate that players cannot dye their hair, have weird hairstyles or wear any accessories,"" the official said, adding it was a nationwide edict that had already been in place before the match.
	Many on Weibo were aghast at the ruling and the brouhaha trended on the social media network, racking up more than 400 million views.
	""I thought I was reading North Korean news,"" joked one user on Weibo.
	""Am I really living in the 21st Century?"" asked another.
	President Xi Jinping is a soccer fan and has grand plans to make China a leading country in the world's most popular sport.
	However, soccer has found itself in the crosshairs of the Communist Party's drive for a homogenized society.
	Players on the national team routinely cover their arms with long sleeves or bandages to hide their tattoos.
	Body ink is traditionally frowned upon in China but it is increasingly popular among young adults, even as authorities make plain their disdain for it."

Chinese online platform JD Health rises 50 per cent in stock debut

	Shares in China's biggest online health care platform rose 50% in their Hong Kong stock market debut Tuesday, reflecting investor enthusiasm for the fledgling industry as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
	JD Health, an arm of JD.Com Inc., China's biggest online retailer, sells medications, hospital care packages and online consulting by doctors.
	Chinese internet companies increasingly offer health services in a society where hospitals are crowded and distribution of drugs and medical supplies outside major cities is uneven. Online consulting with Chinese-speaking physicians is popular with families from China who live in the West or other developing countries.
	Other competitors include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group's Alibaba Health; Baidu Health, run by search giant Baidu.com Inc.; and WeDoctor, run by Tencent Holding, operator of the popular WeChat messaging service.
	The coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for Chinese online platforms.
	Investors have ""high hopes for this kind of companies to develop in China,"" said Jackson Wong, asset management director for Amber Hill Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	The ruling Communist Party has encouraged growth of the industry by authorizing online pharmacies to deliver prescription drugs.
	During the pandemic, patients switched from going online only for urgent care to staying in touch with doctors about chronic conditions, according to industry analyst Kevin Chang of Bain & Co.
	""This new pattern of digital engagements is likely to continue and to increase the frequency of consultations,"" Chang said in a report.
	Consumer spending and business activity have rebounded to above pre-pandemic levels after China, where the pandemic began in December, declared the disease under control in March and eased most controls. Restrictions on travellers coming from abroad still are in place and visitors to public buildings are checked for fever.
	JD Health raised about $3.8 billion by selling 20% of the company to public shareholders.
	It was Hong Kong's second-biggest stock offering this year behind parent JD.Com, which has shares traded in New York and raised $4.5 billion in June when it joined the Hong Kong exchange.
	The ruling party is encouraging use of online health services to reduce the burden on hospitals.
	JD Health said it plans to expand its online pharmacy and develop ""smart healthcare solutions"" supported by artificial intelligence to work with physicians.
	The company says it had 72.5 million active users in June, up 30% over a year earlier.
	The industry might face tougher competition once the coronavirus is brought under control and patients have more offline options, said Wong.
	""If vaccines are very effective and people start going out again, the growth of these online service providers might not be as high,"" said Wong. ""That would be the biggest risk for this kind of company.""

              A year on, markets bustling in Chinese city where COVID-19 emerged
          
","
              Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.
        ","
                  Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/a-year-on-markets-bustling-in-chinese-city-where-covid-19-emerged-1.5221459,"WUHAN -- 
	Hundreds of shoppers pack a wet market on a December weekday morning in the Chinese city of Wuhan, jostling to buy fresh vegetables and live fish, frogs and turtles.
	Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.
	""I'm not afraid, what is there to be afraid of?"" said Nie Guangzhen, a fish and vegetable vendor.
	Nie and other shop owners along a narrow street, part of the larger wet market, were busily gutting fish for streams of buyers - some not wearing masks - as city cleaners sprayed down the pavements.
	Few hints remain of Wuhan's early role in the coronavirus pandemic, which has since infected more than 67 million people globally, killing around 1.5 million people.
	China first alerted the World Health Organization to 27 cases of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan on Dec. 31. Authorities shut down a wet market in the city the next day, after discovering some patients were vendors or dealers.
	That marked the start of a dark period for the city of 11 million in central China. Infections spiraled quickly to 50,000 cases, including almost 4,000 deaths. Officials responded by swiftly imposing a tough 76-day lockdown, erecting kilometers of thick yellow barricades through the city's deserted streets to keep people at home and businesses closed.
	The measures paid off. Wuhan has not recorded a new locally transmitted case in several months and is now indistinguishable from other Chinese cities with crowded shopping streets, traffic jams and tightly packed restaurants.
	""I really missed these more fun and exciting times, like going out shopping and eating with my friends,"" said 27-year-old shopper Hu Hang on Monday at a packed Wuhan night market selling Christmas sweaters among other goods.
	In the busy street, hawkers sell flowers and balloons, street performers including dancers and a clown perform while music blares from shops lining the road.
	The city's recovery is a sharp contrast to other major economies heading into the Christmas and New year holiday season.
	In the United States, the health system is under severe pressure as cases mount and health officials warn the worst is yet to come. The country recorded 15,000 deaths over the past week, the deadliest seven days of the pandemic since April.
	Several European countries have rolled out tight restrictions on gatherings ahead of Christmas, fearing a return to peak levels of cases because of festive celebrations.
	China's relative success in controlling the virus has become a key talking point in Chinese state media.
	""I haven't been overseas, so I don't understand it well, but looking at the TV it seems like foreign countries don't put human life first,"" said Mr Li, a 54-year old Wuhan street food vendor, who reopened his shop in June. ""The ideology of foreign countries is not as good as that of China.""
	China has taken steps, including mass testing millions of residents following small-scale outbreaks, to prevent a second wave of infections seen in many other cities and countries.
	At the gates of residential compounds, staff in blue tents monitor residents' smartphone health codes. In a public park, slogans on red propaganda banners urge people to remain vigilant.
	Wearing face masks is not mandatory, but most people do so in public.
	And while shoppers have returned to Wuhan's streets, Li and others say business is yet to return fully to normal.
	""The whole situation is not great, it's still a lot worse compared to the last few years,"" Li said, referring to a slump in sales during the time after lockdown when people were too afraid to return to the streets.
	Still, for many residents, lockdown memories have been superseded by the city's swift reopening - alongside new precautions.
	""I don't worry, because I'm doing a good job of protection,"" said wet market vendor Nie, who said she will continue to disinfect and boil her clothes. ""Even if there is a second wave, I will just stick to it.”

	China's politically sensitive trade surplus soared to a record US$75.4 billion in November as exports surged 21.1% over a year earlier, propelled by American consumer demand.
	Exports to the United States rose 46% despite lingering tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington, customs data showed Monday.
	Total exports rose to $268 billion, accelerating from October's 11.4% growth. Imports gained 5% to $192.6 billion, up from the previous month's 4.7%.
	Chinese exporters have benefited from the economy's relatively early reopening after the Communist Party declared the coronavirus pandemic under control in March while foreign competitors still are hampered by anti-disease controls.
	“Exports were much stronger than expected in November,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.
	Forecasters say that surge is unlikely to last into 2021 once coronavirus vaccines are rolled out.
	“We expect export performance to be less impressive,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.
	China's global trade surplus for the first 11 months of 2020 is $460 billion, up 21.4% from this time last year, already one of the highest ever recorded.
	Exports to the United States rose to $51.9 billion while imports of American goods gained 33% to $14.6 billion. The trade surplus with the United States swelled 52% over a year earlier to $37.3 billion.
	Beijing promised to buy more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports as part of the “Phase 1” agreement signed in January and aimed at ending a costly tariff battle over Chinese technology ambitions. China fell behind on meeting those commitments earlier in the year but is catching up as demand rebounds.
	The two governments agreed to postpone further planned tariff hikes on each other's goods but most penalties already imposed on billions of dollars of imports stayed in place.
	Chinese imports are growing faster by volume than by value because demand has been chilled by the shutdown of travel and industry, driving prices lower.
	China is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan falls.
	China's economy shrank by 6.8% from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2% in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9% in the three months ending in September.
	Automakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other raw materials. Retail sales are back above pre-virus levels and rose 4.3% over a year earlier in October.
	Also in November, exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 8.6% over a year ago to $37.5 billion while imports of European goods gained 4.5% to $26.2 billion. China's trade surplus with Europe widened by 20% to $11.3 billion."

	A subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma, according to a person familiar with a Justice Department tax investigation of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden's son.
	The breadth of the subpoena, issued Tuesday, underscores the wide-angle lens prosecutors are taking as they examine the younger Biden's finances and international business ventures.
	Hunter Biden's ties to Burisma in particular have long dogged the policy work and political aspirations of his father, Joe Biden, now the president-elect of the United States. It's unclear whether Hunter Biden's work at the Ukrainian company is a central part of the federal investigation or whether prosecutors are simply seeking information about all his sources of income in recent years.
	The person was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	A lawyer for the younger Biden, George Mesires, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment for this story and a spokesman for the Biden transition team declined to comment.
	Hunter Biden confirmed Wednesday that his taxes are under federal investigation. The revelation comes at a delicate time for the president-elect, who is building out his Cabinet and will soon decide on his nominee to run the Justice Department, the same department overseeing the investigation into his son.
	In addition to the Burisma-related request, the subpoena issued last week also seeks information on Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other financial transactions.
	The probe was launched in 2018, the year before his father announced his candidacy for president. At one point in the investigation, federal prosecutors were also examining potential money laundering offences, two people familiar with the matter told the AP.
	Hunter Biden said he only learned of the investigation on Tuesday.
	The younger Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then vice-president, was helping conduct the Obama administration's foreign policy with Ukraine. President Donald Trump and his allies have long argued, without evidence, that Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine influenced the Obama administration's policies toward the Eastern European nation.
	Senate Republicans said in a report earlier this year that the appointment may have posed a conflict of interest but did not provide evidence that any policies were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	The president-elect is not believed to be a focus of the investigation. He has not weighed in on the merits of the investigation, saying only to reporters on Friday that he was ""proud of my son.""
	For months, the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh has also been collecting information from Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and others as part of the Justice Department's process to receive and analyze information related to Ukraine, including documents Giuliani wanted to present to prosecutors that he had been gathering in Ukraine about Joe and Hunter Biden.
	In announcing that process in February, Barr cautioned that the department had to be careful about any information coming from Ukraine, saying: ""There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, a lot of cross currents. And we can't take anything we received from Ukraine at face value.""
	The former New York City mayor was a main character when the House voted to impeach Trump. The impeachment inquiry centred on Trump's dealings with Ukraine's president and whether he abused his office by seeking the investigation into the Bidens. Giuliani pressured officials to do the investigations and has been pushing unsubstantiated corruption allegations against the Bidens.
	Giuliani himself had also been under federal investigation, with federal prosecutors in Manhattan examining whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the matter. It was unclear whether that investigation remains active as Trump has discussed the possibility of preemptive pardons for some of his family members and close associates, including Giuliani."

	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.
	Pence also tweeted about Lai, saying the charges against him are ""an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere."""

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world. 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was “alarmed” that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the People’s Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canada’s arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	“Our government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,” said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	“It was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence … because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,” Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in “hostage diplomacy” and that the Chinese government back then “is completely different to the Chinese government today.”
	Conservative leader Erin O’Toole called the joint training exercise a “dangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.”
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	China’s President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending China’s interests.
	Meng’s arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department’s efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	“We will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,” Sajjan said.

              Diverse TV holiday season includes all-Asian Lifetime movie
          
","
              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”

                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/diverse-tv-holiday-season-includes-all-asian-lifetime-movie-1.5227204,"
	In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”
	Retorts Suzy: “I'm from Maine.”
	A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like “Chinese virus” and “kung flu.”
	“I think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,” Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. “I really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.”
	“A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.
	Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.
	“It was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,” Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and “full of Christmas heart.”
	Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).
	Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in “The Farewell” and “Mulan,” Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.
	“It was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,” Ma said in an email. “Lifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.”
	In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.
	“I think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,” Giroux says.
	Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.
	“I'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,” Giroux says. “That's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.”
	Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching “Crazy Rich Asians,” the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.
	“You hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,” Lai says. ”I am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.“
	The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.
	“I love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,” says Jennifer Liao, the director. “It's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.”
	“Sugar & Spice” is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's “Christmas Ever After.”
	Does Liao feel pressure as “the first” even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? “I feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,” Liao says.
	Lai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.
	“I think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,” Lai says. “We get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.”

	India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.
	Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the six-month standoff between the two countries' armies ""has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in the status along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.""
	Srivastava was responding to a statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in Beijing on Thursday that ""the rights and wrongs of what has happened in the China-India border area are very clear and the responsibility lies squarely with the Indian side.""
	Hua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. ""We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,"" she said.
	The standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.
	The countries have held a series of talks on ending the standoff without any breakthrough."

Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistant

	U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.
	Bloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.
	It quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau ""according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.""
	China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.
	Bloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.
	It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.
	""We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,"" a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
	Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.
	China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.
	China this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.
	Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials."

	China's sales of SUVs, minivans and sedans rose by double digits in November as the country recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, but were below pre-virus levels for the year, an industry group reported Friday.
	Sales in the industry's biggest global market rose 11.6% over a year earlier to 2.3 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 12.6% to 2.8 million, holding steady at October's growth rate.
	From January to November, passenger vehicle sales were off 7.6% from the same period of 2019, at 17.8 million. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 20.6% to 4.7 million.
	Full-year auto sales are on track to decline for a third year after hitting a peak in 2017.
	China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first country to reopen its economy after the disease was declared under control in March.
	November sales of all-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled, rising 104.9% over a year earlier. Sales in the first 11 months of 2020 edged back above pre-virus levels, rising 3.9% over a year earlier.
	Auto demand already was weak before China closed factories and dealerships in February to fight the coronavirus. Consumers are uneasy about slowing economic growth and a tariff war with Washington.
	That hurts global automakers that are looking to China to propel sales growth and are spending heavily to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet Chinese government sales quotas."

A Chinese citizen who allegedly financed a turtle-trafficking ring has been extradited from Malaysia to the United States, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in a statement on Thursday.
	Kang Juntao, 24, from Hangzhou in eastern China, was initially charged with money laundering last February. Between June 2017 and December 2018, he allegedly financed a nationwide ring of people who purchased turtles in the U.S. belonging to five protected species, and arranged for them to be illegally shipped to Hong Kong.
	""The turtles were inhumanely bound with duct tape and placed in socks so as not to alert customs authorities,"" the DOJ statement said.
	According to Kang's indictment, at least 1,500 turtles -- with a total value of US$2,250,000 -- were smuggled out of the U.S.
	Using a PayPal account, Kang allegedly purchased turtles from sellers advertising on social media or reptile trade websites.
	These sellers allegedly shipped the turtles to ""middlemen"" who were ""typically Chinese citizens who entered the country on student visas,"" according to the DOJ. Kang allegedly paid and instructed them to repackage the turtles, and use false labels for shipment to Hong Kong.
	Once in Hong Kong, the turtles were allegedly sold on the black market for thousands of dollars each.
	Kang allegedly did not declare the turtles to U.S. or Chinese customs, or obtain required permits from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
	Authorities allege Kang trafficked the eastern box turtle, the Florida box turtle, the Gulf Coast box turtle, the spotted turtle, and the wood turtle -- all protected species under the CITES treaty.
	Kang was arrested at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport last January before his extradition to the U.S. on Thursday.

              Bahrain has announced plans to give the public free coronavirus vaccines, as Saudi Arabia said it approved an inoculation by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to fight the pandemic.

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/bahrain-plans-free-shots-saudi-arabia-approves-pfizer-vaccine-1.5226736,"DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES -- 
	Bahrain has announced plans to give the public free coronavirus vaccines, as Saudi Arabia said it approved an inoculation by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to fight the pandemic.
	The island nation of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, made the vaccine pledge in an announcement published late Thursday by its state-run Bahrain News Agency.
	""A safe vaccine will be provided free of charge to all citizens and residents within the kingdom,"" the statement said, without elaborating on which vaccine it would offer.
	Bahrain plans to inoculate everyone 18 years and older in the kingdom at 27 different medical facilities, hoping to be able to vaccinate 10,000 people a day. Bahrain, an island in the Persian Gulf home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, has a population of around 1.5 million people.
	A week ago, Bahrain said it had become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine after the United Kingdom.
	The Pfizer shots, a so-called ""mRNA vaccine,"" contain a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. To be vaccinated, a person receives two shots over 21 days.
	In the time since, Bahrain has not responded to questions from The Associated Press, including on Friday. Pfizer told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the ""timing of delivery and the volume of doses,"" were confidential and declined to comment.
	Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculated some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine is an ""inactivated"" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it.
	The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday described the Sinopharm vaccine as 86 per cent effective, but provided few details and answered no questions. It marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of that shot.
	Earlier Thursday, Saudi Arabia's Food and Drug Authority said it had registered the Pfizer vaccine ""so that health authorities in the kingdom can then import and use the vaccine.""
	The kingdom said it based its decision on information given by Pfizer on Nov. 24, without elaborating. Pfizer on Nov. 18 said its vaccine is 95 per cent effective.
	A major challenge for the Pfizer shot in the Mideast remains the weather, however. The vaccines must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
	Saudi Arabia said its Health Ministry later would announce plans on how it would distribute the vaccine in the kingdom, the biggest Gulf Arab state, with a population of 34 million people.

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's historically challenging transition to power is suddenly becoming even more complicated.
	A federal investigation into the finances of Biden's son Hunter threatens to embolden congressional Republicans, who have already shown little willingness to work with the incoming president or even acknowledge his clear victory in last month's election. For sure, it will complicate Senate confirmation hearings for Biden's yet-to-be-named attorney general, who could ultimately have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son.
	It all raises the prospect of even deeper dysfunction in a capital that is already struggling to address the nation's most pressing crises, including a surging pandemic whose daily death tolls are beginning to surpass the devastation of the Sept. 11 attacks. Republicans, particularly those eyeing presidential runs in 2024, are making clear they will press Biden on the issue.
	""Joe Biden needs to pledge today that he will co-operate with the federal investigation and answer any questions under oath,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Thursday, ""and that if he is sworn in as president, no federal investigator or attorney working on the Hunter Biden criminal case will be removed.""
	Hunter Biden has long been a source of worry for his father's campaign and was the subject of repeated unsupported accusations by President Donald Trump and his allies. But news of the probe, which was revealed on Wednesday and scrutinizes some of Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other transactions, caught most of his father's staffers by surprise.
	The president-elect had no public appearance Thursday as he moved forward with filling out his administration. But the investigation threatens to destabilize a transition that has prioritized a methodical rollout of Cabinet selections, White House hires and policy goals -- all meant to guarantee momentum when Biden takes office and immediately has to grapple with a surging pandemic and shaky economy.
	Most notably, the probe casts a spotlight on one of Biden's most important choices: his attorney general.
	Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland have emerged as the leading contenders, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press this week. But dynamics could shift, as any Biden choice now will be scrutinized for any perceived loyalty to the president-elect and bias in any probe of his son.
	Both Garland and especially Jones have longtime ties to Biden.
	The president-elect himself is not a subject of the investigation. And Biden aides believe that because other Hunter Biden stories have blown over, this will, too. They note that a tax fraud investigation pales in comparison to Trump's refusal to concede the election or to the pandemic that has killed more than 290,000 Americans.
	Biden is expected to announce more Cabinet picks, but not attorney general, on Friday.
	Trump's initial public response was surprisingly muted, just a pair of tweets about a Fox News segment on the story Wednesday night. But privately, he demanded to know why the investigation was not revealed ahead of Election Day, accusing officials of deliberately stalling in order to help Biden's chances, according to two Republicans familiar with the conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.
	Other Republicans, including possible presidential contenders, were anything but shy in piling on.
	""If there were ever circumstances that created a conflict of interest and called for a special counsel, I think those circumstances are present here,"" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Thursday. ""The Biden family has been trading on Joe Biden's public office for 50 years. Do we really think that that will change if Joe Biden becomes president, the highest office in the land?""
	Some of Trump's children have also faced some legal questions.
	Donald Trump Jr. was scrutinized in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe for the 2016 meeting he had with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. And Ivanka Trump was recently deposed by investigators from the District of Columbia attorney general's office as part of its lawsuit alleging the misuse of inaugural funds.
	The Hunter Biden investigation is the latest in a series of politically charged inquiries that the Justice Department has grappled with in the past five years, following probes into Hillary Clinton's email use and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
	Regardless of the facts of the investigation, a new Justice Department will likely feel compelled to assert its independence from the White House following allegations that its actions were overly politicized during the Trump administration. Biden has said he will play no role in department investigative decisions.
	""There are plenty of people that are going to have their hands in this one, but I think it's really going to be driven by the new administration's push to have total independence on any investigation,"" said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Weinstein, a New Jersey defence lawyer.
	""I think that's going to be paramount,"" he added. ""They are going to bend over backwards to make sure that they do the contrary to the current administration -- which is independence, let the investigation takes its course.""
	In this case, though, there is no perfect outcome for Biden.
	A protracted criminal investigation that results in an indictment would be a major distraction and then some as the new president tries to implement his agenda. But if the Justice Department decides against bringing charges, officials will feel pressure to explain their steps and reassure the American public the inquiry was done in a competent and thorough way.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including to Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe.
	The federal investigation, centring on potential tax crimes, had been going on at least a year before Biden announced his candidacy. Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to voting because of a department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts.
	Biden, fiercely protective of his own family, was said to be, in a statement released by his transition, ""deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	Biden struck a similarly defiant tone throughout the campaign whenever questions emerged about his son, which they frequently did. When Trump assailed Hunter Biden as a drug user during the first presidential debate in Cleveland, his father acknowledged that Hunter had had past substance abuse issues but added, ""He's worked on it. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.""
	The spotlight on Hunter Biden intensified in the election's final weeks, after Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed unsubstantiated claims about his foreign business dealings. Those were based in part on New York Post reporting on a laptop that supposedly once belonged to Hunter Biden and was abandoned at a Delaware repair shop.
	Hunter Biden had joined the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then the vice-president, was helping conduct Obama administration foreign policy with Ukraine. But, in a subsequent report, Senate Republicans did not produce any evidence that the hiring influenced U.S. policies.
	Joe Biden largely refused to even acknowledge the laptop controversy. His son, meanwhile, kept almost completely out of the public eye during the nearly 18 months his father was running for president.
	One of the few times he was seen was on stage outside the convention centre in Wilmington, Delaware, as his father was surrounded by joyous family members following his speech declaring victory in the presidential election. Hunter Biden, and his baby son, were right in the middle.

              'None of us imagined this': Michael Kovrig's wife marks two-year anniversary of his detention

              On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrig’s imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.

	On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrig’s imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.
	""Here we are, two years later, still speaking about him being in detention. None of us would have imagined this was going to be the case,"" said Vina Nadjibulla in an interview on CTV’s Power Play on Thursday.
	""I hoped sincerely that Michael would be home by now and instead he’s facing a prospect of his third Christmas alone, in isolation, in detention.""
	Kovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested in China on Dec. 10, 2018, and charged with allegations of state spying for Canada. The Canadian government calls their detention arbitrary, while most in the diplomatic community view it as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days prior in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request.
	Consular access has been limited throughout the pandemic; the two men went 10 months without communication with Canadian representatives.
	""Our contact has been very limited between January and October. There were no consular visits, there were very few letters from Michael. Finally, in October we were able to get a consular visit and at least confirmation and a reassurance that he is still healthy and is doing well,"" said Nadjibulla, who is married to Kovrig but separated.
	Canada’s Ambassador to China Dominic Barton who is leading the effort to secure Kovrig and Spavor’s release, told a House of Commons committee this week that the two men looked ""robust"" and that one ""would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Nadjibulla called that long-awaited visit this fall a ""huge relief"" but notes she remains deeply concerned about his mental health.
	""Michael is doing everything he possibly can to keep his mind occupied with positive thoughts, with virtuous thoughts, with prayers of gratitude, with philosophical passages. Reading really provides him solace day-to-day, he essentially says that is what gets him through moment-to-moment, is being able to read and have access to books, which we’ve been advocating for quite a bit,"" said Nadjibulla.
	The Liberal government remains adamant it’s doing all it can to free the men, despite opposition criticism that Ottawa has been ""kowtowing"" to China over the last several years.
	""Today is the sad anniversary of the illegal abduction and imprisonment of two innocent Canadians in China,"" said Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole during a press conference on Thursday.
	""For months China has unfairly targeted our farming exports. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out mass internment of the Uighurs in concentration camps and still the Liberals keep pushing for more involvement and more engagement with China.""
	Optimism sparked last week when the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Justice Department was in talks with Meng’s legal team to resolve her fraud charges and allow her to return home should she admit to criminal wrongdoing. It led to speculation that the arrangement could pave a way for Kovrig and Spavor’s freedom.
	Nadjibulla says, more broadly, she was left hopeful after hearing that during the first call between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden the leaders discussed the fate of the two men.
	""I pray that we will be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.

              Politicians urge people to buy Australian wine in defiance of China

              Politicians from various Western countries have asked consumers to buy Australian wine in order to fight back against China's punitive tariffs on the beverage.

	Politicians from various Western countries have asked consumers to buy Australian wine in order to fight back against China's punitive tariffs on the beverage.
	China is the most important export market for Australian wine, and winemakers are scrambling to find new markets following Beijing's decision to slap tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine imports amid an escalating trade war between the two nations.
	Now a number of public figures associated with the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which calls itself ""an international cross-party group of legislators working to reform the approach of democratic countries to China,"" have called on consumers to stand up to Beijing.
	""We are asking you all to join us in standing against Xi Jinping's authoritarian bullying,"" said Miriam Lexmann, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) representing the Christian Democrats, in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday.
	""By drinking a bottle or two of Australian wine and letting the Chinese Communist Party know that we will not be bullied,"" added Elisabet Lann, a municipal councilor from Sweden's Christian Democrats.
	Other politicians featured in the video include Australian MP Kimberley Kitching, US Senator Ted Yoho and Shiori Yamao, an independent member of Japan's House of Representatives.
	Tony Battaglene, CEO of Australian Grape and Wine, a national association, said Beijing's tariffs have endangered business with mainland China.
	Battaglene works with around 800 wine producers in Australia who have ""built their businesses"" around exporting to China and are now left with no backup plan, he added.
	""We were surprised, we were shocked,"" Battaglene told CNN Business. ""Having the extent of these interim tariffs, I mean essentially they will close the market to Australian bottled wine, to premium wine, in China. There's no way that we can compete at those levels.""
	China's Commerce Ministry announced Friday that its decision was made after finding preliminary evidence of dumping. Australian officials have bitterly protested the move, saying that China has been unable to provide proof.
	The wine war is taking place against the backdrop of a wider deterioration in relations. Australia has upset China this year by calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing later targeted Canberra over trade, namely by suspending some imports of beef and slapping heavy tariffs on barley."

              'Two Michaels' mark two jailed years in China, no development in their cases

	In his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.
	As much as that matters, Kovrig's wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival.
	She says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.
	Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.
	Canada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they've endured their captivity was inspiring.
	""Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, and their families, have shown truly remarkable perseverance in the face of an unimaginable situation,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.
	Kovrig is ""marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength"" to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week.
	""He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,"" she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.
	""He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.""
	A statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.
	The statement said that ""contrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.""
	The statement also said that ""the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.""
	The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor's friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.
	Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada's diplomatic corps, a career-focused on preventing deadly conflicts.
	""He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,"" said Nadjibulla.
	She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy's ""War and Peace,"" to Nelson Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom."" He's reread one of his pre-prison favourites, ""Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.
	""It essentially posits that it's important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it's very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,"" she said.
	Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of ""fear into prudence, pain into information,"" said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added ""anger into determination and grievance into resolve"" to that philosophy.
	He has been drawn to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, ""which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,"" said Nadjibulla.
	Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.
	Robert Malley, Kovrig's boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They're also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.
	Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig's discipline.
	""None of us can be prepared for that, unless you're in the military and you're told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,"" said Malley.
	When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.
	Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton's on-site virtual visit in October -- his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn't allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.
	He was shocked at the pandemic's scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie ""Contagion.""
	Kovrig is also aware that he is one of ""two Michaels"" and understands that both he and Spavor ""are caught in this bigger situation,"" she said. It's not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.
	Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department's attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.
	If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.
	""Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,"" Nadjibulla said. ""They're pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.""

	China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	U.S. diplomatic passport holders visiting Hong Kong and nearby Macao will temporarily no longer receive visa-free entry privileges, spokesperson Hua Chunying said.
	U.S. administration officials, congressional staffers, employees of non-governmental organizations and their immediate family members will face ""reciprocal sanctions,"" Hua said.
	She was apparently referring to U.S. sanctions that bar certain Chinese and Hong Kong officials from travelling to the U.S. or having dealings with the U.S. financial system over their roles in imposing a sweeping National Security Law passed this summer that ushered in a crackdown on free speech and opposition political activity in Hong Kong.
	Hua said the move was taken ""given that the U.S. side is using the Hong Kong issue to seriously interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's core interests.""
	Those sanctioned ""have performed egregiously and are primarily responsible on the Hong Kong issue,"" she said at a daily briefing.
	""China once again urges the U.S. side to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and not go further down the wrong and dangerous path,"" Hua said.
	China had long threatened to retaliate against the U.S. sanctions and other actions seen as hostile.
	Earlier, China's official Xinhua News Agency said Trump administration officials are ""digging a hole"" for the next U.S. administration's relationship with China through actions targeting the country and its officials.
	Steps such as restricting visas for the 92 million members of the ruling Communist Party and their families have ""again exposed the sinister intentions of extreme anti-China forces in Washington to hijack China-U.S. relations for their own political gain,"" Xinhua said in an editorial.
	The U.S. State Department last week cut the duration of such visas from 10 years to one month, another example of the increasingly hard-line stance adopted by the administration in its waning days. That came in addition to the sanctions targeting specific Chinese and Hong Kong officials over their actions in Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has signalled he intends to keep pressure on China, he's also expected to seek a return to more conventional, less confrontational style of diplomacy. Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington's stance toward Beijing.
	""By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-U.S. relations on issues concerning China's core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration's relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains,"" Xinhua said.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.
	Dozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.
	On Wednesday, Pompeo accused U.S. universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was ""poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends.""
	Chinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying U.S. accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.
	Perhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.
	""Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation,"" Xinhua said. ""The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-U.S. relations."""

	The EU's medicines regulator said Wednesday it had been the victim of a cyberattack, just weeks before it is due to decide on special approval for two coronavirus vaccines.
	The Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the incident was being investigated but did not say exactly when it took place or give details about what was targeted.
	""EMA has been the subject of a cyberattack. The agency has swiftly launched a full investigation, in close cooperation with law enforcement and other relevant entities,"" the EMA said in a brief statement.
	""EMA cannot provide additional details whilst the investigation is ongoing. Further information will be made available in due course.""
	A spokeswoman for the agency referred back to the statement when asked for more details by AFP.
	The EMA has said it will give a decision on conditional approval for Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine at a meeting that will be held by December 29 at the latest.
	A ruling on Moderna's version should follow by January 12.
	The regulator is also carrying out reviews of vaccines developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine and Johnson & Johnson.
	The EMA moved to Amsterdam from London after Britain left the European Union in January 2019. It oversees all medicines for the 27-nation EU.
SERIES OF WARNINGS
	The cyberattack on the EMA comes after a series of warnings about hacking related to the coronavirus pandemic.
	Britain accused Russian-based, Kremlin-linked hackers in July of targeting labs conducting coronavirus vaccine research.
	Cybercriminals have tried to attack several pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca and South Korean laboratories, according to the Wall Street Journal.
	Spanish laboratories also reportedly have been attacked by Chinese cybercriminals, the El Pais newspaper reported in September.
	Microsoft urged a crackdown in November on cyberattacks perpetrated by states and ""malign actors"" after a spate of hacks disrupted healthcare organisations fighting the virus.
	IBM said last week that it too had uncovered a string of attacks, again potentially carried out by state actors, against companies involved in the effort to distribute the vaccine.
	The European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union was one target of the attacks, as well as European and Asian companies involved in the supply chain, IBM said.
	Meanwhile, it is not the first time a Netherlands-based international body has been targeted by hackers.
	Dutch authorities expelled four alleged Russian intelligence agents in 2018 after an alleged bid to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, using equipment in the back of a car parked in a neighbouring hotel."

              Why did Mount Everest's height change?
          
","
              China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.
        ","

	The world's highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story.
	China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.
	As definitive as that sounds, geological changes, the complicated business of measuring a mountain and varying criteria for determining the world's highest peak will likely ensure the question isn't settled for good.
	The mountain's height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down.
	The countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest's height earlier this year.
	""Nature tends to strike a balance,"" he told the official Xinhua News Agency. As an example, Dang cited a massive 1934 earthquake that wiped out 150 years of steady height increase in a few moments.
	There's more than one way to measure a mountain.
	Last year, a Nepalese team set up a satellite navigation marker on Everest's peak to gauge its exact position via GPS satellites. A Chinese team undertook a similar mission this spring, though it used the Chinese-made Beidou constellation of navigation satellites, along with other equipment.
	At the same time, Nepalese crews took measurements with modern, laser-equipped versions of instruments called theodolites, first used to gauge the mountain's height in 1856 by measuring angles using trigonometry.
	The Nepalese team also used ground penetrating radar to measure the amount of snow and ice that sits on top of its highest rock.
	China and Nepal jointly presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 metres (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The two had diverged for years over the mountain's actual height.
	The new height is 0.86 metres (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries' two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The agreement announced Tuesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between them.
	Measuring the height above sea level has always been tricky because ocean levels vary considerably depending on tides, magnetism and other factors. Rising sea levels are creating another factor for future measurements.
	How high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain's height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills.
	As measured from the Earth's core, Ecuador's Mount Chimborazo is the world's highest, standing more than 2,072 metres (6,800 feet) above Everest. Because the Earth bulges in the middle, mountains along the equator are farther from the core.
	Measuring from the foot of the mountain to the peak, Hawaii's Mauna Kea is the tallest. Most of it, however, is under the sea.
	This story has been corrected to say that the agreement was announced Tuesday, not Wednesday.

	Companies including the Chinese arm of TripAdvisor Inc. have been ordered by regulators to overhaul their mobile phone apps in what the Chinese government said is a crackdown on pornography and other improper content.
	The National Cyberspace Administration ordered the removal of 105 apps including TripAdvisor from app stores this week, although it gave no details of what each app was accused of doing wrong. It cited what it said were public complaints about obscene, pornographic and violent information or fraud, gambling and prostitution.
	The ruling Communist Party tightly controls what the Chinese public sees online and has launched repeated crackdowns on websites and apps.
	TripAdvisor China, a joint venture between TripAdvisor and its Chinese partner Trip.com, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
	Following the removal of its app in China, Nasdaq-listed TripAdvisor's stock price was down 1.68% to $29.59 at the market's close in the U.S. on Tuesday.
	TripAdvisor owns a 40% stake in TripAdvisor China, with Trip.com owning the other 60%. Under the partnership, the companies share its travel inventories and content.

              UAE says Chinese vaccine 86 per cent effective, offers few details

              The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.

	The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.
	The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.
	The UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.
	The UAE's Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they ""have reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""
	""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.
	It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.
	Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.
	The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.
	Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus' spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.
	Top officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.
	Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.
	In transport, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must remain at cold temperatures -- negative 70 degrees Celsius (negative 94 degree Fahrenheit) and negative 20 degrees Celsius (negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively.
	The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people in China had received its vaccine.
	Meanwhile Wednesday, Abu Dhabi announced it would resume ""all economic, tourism, cultural and entertainment activities in the emirate within two weeks."" It attributed the decision to ""successes"" in halting the spread of the coronavirus.
	Abu Dhabi has required those travelling into the emirate from the UAE's other six sheikhdoms to take a coronavirus test within 48 hours prior to arrival.
	Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over 9 million people.
	In Iran, meanwhile, President Hassan Rouhani angrily blamed U.S. sanctions for making it difficult for Tehran to purchase medicine and health supplies amid the pandemic.
	And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the first shipment of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, calling it a ""big day of celebration"" for the country.
	""I believe in this vaccine. I expect it will receive the appropriate approval in the coming days,"" Netanyahu said, adding that he intended to be the first to receive it. ""We see the end of the pandemic.""

	Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are physically and mentally well and showing inspiring resilience as they near the end of their second year of imprisonment by the People's Republic, says Canada's ambassador to China.
	Dominic Barton also says Chinese authorities were paranoid about containing the spread of COVID-19 as they denied consular access to the two men from January to October.
	""Our understanding of why it was the case is that the Chinese are completely paranoid about the virus,"" Barton said in testimony Tuesday night before the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations.
	Barton is leading Canada's efforts in China to win the release of Kovrig and Spavor, who were arrested and imprisoned on Dec. 10, 2018, in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou.
	After months of delay, Barton was most recently granted on-site virtual consular access to Kovrig and Spavor in November, following similar virtual visits with the two Canadians a month earlier.
	""We were obviously very frustrated at not being able to get access even virtually because as far as we know . . . the virus doesn't go through televisions,"" said Barton.
	The Chinese government has charged Kovrig and Spavor with espionage but the Canadian government says their detention is arbitrary and has called repeatedly for their release.
	Barton said it wasn't just Canada that was blocked by the Chinese from visiting prisoners charged in national security cases; the U.S. and Britain faced similar restrictions.
	When Barton was able to see them, he said he was able to verify they were in good physical and mental condition.
	""They are robust,"" said Barton, who was testifying from Beijing via video link. ""You would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Spavor is being held in a prison in the city of Dandong near the North Korean border while Kovrig is in a Beijing area prison.
	""It's a strange thing. We fly to these places, or drive to them in the case of Beijing. And I know that the Michaels (are) literally sort of on the other side of the wall, but you've got, you know, two big TVs,"" he said. ""It's like this.""
	Barton's main purpose for testifying was to describe the three-day Chinese government-controlled visit to Tibet that he and nine other Western diplomats undertook in October. He said he remains concerned about the human rights situation there and that they only saw what the Chinese wanted them to see.
	Even though the area is filled with security cameras, as is the capital of Beijing, Barton said he wandered off a couple of times to visit with locals without his Chinese government minders in tow.
	He said Canada is not reluctant to raise human rights concerns with China even though some people think Canada is in the Chinese ""doghouse"" these days. He also said that even though he knew the visit to Tibet would be controlled, it sent a signal to local people that the outside world still cared about their plight.
	Thursday marked Barton's second appearance before the committee this year, following testimony in February in which he declared ""the chill is real"" in Canadian relations with China.
	In February, Barton described an angry, emotional meeting during his first diplomatic contact with his Chinese counterparts after being appointed to the post in 2019 after a long career in business, which included being the global managing director of the consulting giant McKinsey & Co.
	His position in the company gave Barton high level access in China and across Asia, something the Trudeau government is hoping to leverage to win freedom for Kovrig and Spavor while maintaining economic relations with its second largest trading partner.

              Another judge blocks Trump's TikTok ban; app still in limbo

	A federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.
	The Trump administration had tried to ban the short-form video app from smartphone app stores in the U.S. and cut it off from vital technical services. TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.
	Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said in a ruling Monday that the Commerce Department ""likely overstepped"" its use of presidential emergency powers ""and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to consider obvious alternatives.""
	Nichols is the second federal judge to fully block the Trump administration's economic sanctions against the app as the court cases proceed.
	The Trump administration has alleged that TikTok is a security threat because the Chinese government could spy on app users' personal data. TikTok has denied it's a security threat but said it's still trying to work with the administration to resolve its concerns.
	Trump in September gave his tentative blessing to a proposal by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns by having the U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart invest in TikTok. Oracle would manage U.S. user data under the arrangement. But a federal agency still has to review and finalize an arrangement.
	A government deadline for ByteDance to complete the deal passed on Friday, and it's not clear what the status of the agreement is.
	The Treasury Department, which chairs the agency reviewing the deal, said Friday that the agency ""is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks arising from the transaction.""
	The Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, it's not clear what his administration will carry on the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to secure a ban, or increase the involvement of U.S. companies."

	A women's university soccer match in China descended into farce and was eventually called off after players were told that they were not allowed to have dyed hair, state media said Tuesday.
	The incident trended on the Twitter-like Weibo, angering many people, and comes after the men's national team were ordered to cover up their tattoos.
	The latest high-profile example of the shrinking space for individualism in communist-ruled China came when the women's sides of Fuzhou and Jimei universities met in a college league match in the southeastern province of Fujian.
	The teams were reportedly warned about the ban on dyed hair beforehand but as they were getting ready for the match on November 30 officials spotted that players from both sides had failed to heed the reminder.
	At least one Fuzhou University player was then spotted frantically having her hair dyed again in an attempt to return it to its original colour, but it failed to dry in time, the Beijing News said.
	The newspaper, citing someone at the scene who gave the pseudonym Zhang Zhi, said that some Fuzhou players also ran off to a nearby hair salon to buy black hair dye.
	However, one Fuzhou player was deemed ineligible because her hair was ""still not black enough"" so they were unable to field enough players, consequently forfeiting the match 3-0, the report said.
	Fuzhou University declined to comment when contacted by AFP. However, the China News cited the university as saying that the ban on dyed hair was ""in accordance with relevant regulations"" passed down from the education ministry in Beijing.
	""The relevant documents stipulate that players cannot dye their hair, have weird hairstyles or wear any accessories,"" the official said, adding it was a nationwide edict that had already been in place before the match.
	Many on Weibo were aghast at the ruling and the brouhaha trended on the social media network, racking up more than 400 million views.
	""I thought I was reading North Korean news,"" joked one user on Weibo.
	""Am I really living in the 21st Century?"" asked another.
	President Xi Jinping is a soccer fan and has grand plans to make China a leading country in the world's most popular sport.
	However, soccer has found itself in the crosshairs of the Communist Party's drive for a homogenized society.
	Players on the national team routinely cover their arms with long sleeves or bandages to hide their tattoos.
	Body ink is traditionally frowned upon in China but it is increasingly popular among young adults, even as authorities make plain their disdain for it."

	Shares in China's biggest online health care platform rose 50% in their Hong Kong stock market debut Tuesday, reflecting investor enthusiasm for the fledgling industry as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
	JD Health, an arm of JD.Com Inc., China's biggest online retailer, sells medications, hospital care packages and online consulting by doctors.
	Chinese internet companies increasingly offer health services in a society where hospitals are crowded and distribution of drugs and medical supplies outside major cities is uneven. Online consulting with Chinese-speaking physicians is popular with families from China who live in the West or other developing countries.
	Other competitors include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group's Alibaba Health; Baidu Health, run by search giant Baidu.com Inc.; and WeDoctor, run by Tencent Holding, operator of the popular WeChat messaging service.
	The coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for Chinese online platforms.
	Investors have ""high hopes for this kind of companies to develop in China,"" said Jackson Wong, asset management director for Amber Hill Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	The ruling Communist Party has encouraged growth of the industry by authorizing online pharmacies to deliver prescription drugs.
	During the pandemic, patients switched from going online only for urgent care to staying in touch with doctors about chronic conditions, according to industry analyst Kevin Chang of Bain & Co.
	""This new pattern of digital engagements is likely to continue and to increase the frequency of consultations,"" Chang said in a report.
	Consumer spending and business activity have rebounded to above pre-pandemic levels after China, where the pandemic began in December, declared the disease under control in March and eased most controls. Restrictions on travellers coming from abroad still are in place and visitors to public buildings are checked for fever.
	JD Health raised about $3.8 billion by selling 20% of the company to public shareholders.
	It was Hong Kong's second-biggest stock offering this year behind parent JD.Com, which has shares traded in New York and raised $4.5 billion in June when it joined the Hong Kong exchange.
	The ruling party is encouraging use of online health services to reduce the burden on hospitals.
	JD Health said it plans to expand its online pharmacy and develop ""smart healthcare solutions"" supported by artificial intelligence to work with physicians.
	The company says it had 72.5 million active users in June, up 30% over a year earlier.
	The industry might face tougher competition once the coronavirus is brought under control and patients have more offline options, said Wong.
	""If vaccines are very effective and people start going out again, the growth of these online service providers might not be as high,"" said Wong. ""That would be the biggest risk for this kind of company.""

	Hundreds of shoppers pack a wet market on a December weekday morning in the Chinese city of Wuhan, jostling to buy fresh vegetables and live fish, frogs and turtles.
	Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.
	""I'm not afraid, what is there to be afraid of?"" said Nie Guangzhen, a fish and vegetable vendor.
	Nie and other shop owners along a narrow street, part of the larger wet market, were busily gutting fish for streams of buyers - some not wearing masks - as city cleaners sprayed down the pavements.
	Few hints remain of Wuhan's early role in the coronavirus pandemic, which has since infected more than 67 million people globally, killing around 1.5 million people.
	China first alerted the World Health Organization to 27 cases of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan on Dec. 31. Authorities shut down a wet market in the city the next day, after discovering some patients were vendors or dealers.
	That marked the start of a dark period for the city of 11 million in central China. Infections spiraled quickly to 50,000 cases, including almost 4,000 deaths. Officials responded by swiftly imposing a tough 76-day lockdown, erecting kilometers of thick yellow barricades through the city's deserted streets to keep people at home and businesses closed.
	The measures paid off. Wuhan has not recorded a new locally transmitted case in several months and is now indistinguishable from other Chinese cities with crowded shopping streets, traffic jams and tightly packed restaurants.
	""I really missed these more fun and exciting times, like going out shopping and eating with my friends,"" said 27-year-old shopper Hu Hang on Monday at a packed Wuhan night market selling Christmas sweaters among other goods.
	In the busy street, hawkers sell flowers and balloons, street performers including dancers and a clown perform while music blares from shops lining the road.
	The city's recovery is a sharp contrast to other major economies heading into the Christmas and New year holiday season.
	In the United States, the health system is under severe pressure as cases mount and health officials warn the worst is yet to come. The country recorded 15,000 deaths over the past week, the deadliest seven days of the pandemic since April.
	Several European countries have rolled out tight restrictions on gatherings ahead of Christmas, fearing a return to peak levels of cases because of festive celebrations.
	China's relative success in controlling the virus has become a key talking point in Chinese state media.
	""I haven't been overseas, so I don't understand it well, but looking at the TV it seems like foreign countries don't put human life first,"" said Mr Li, a 54-year old Wuhan street food vendor, who reopened his shop in June. ""The ideology of foreign countries is not as good as that of China.""
	China has taken steps, including mass testing millions of residents following small-scale outbreaks, to prevent a second wave of infections seen in many other cities and countries.
	At the gates of residential compounds, staff in blue tents monitor residents' smartphone health codes. In a public park, slogans on red propaganda banners urge people to remain vigilant.
	Wearing face masks is not mandatory, but most people do so in public.
	And while shoppers have returned to Wuhan's streets, Li and others say business is yet to return fully to normal.
	""The whole situation is not great, it's still a lot worse compared to the last few years,"" Li said, referring to a slump in sales during the time after lockdown when people were too afraid to return to the streets.
	Still, for many residents, lockdown memories have been superseded by the city's swift reopening - alongside new precautions.
	""I don't worry, because I'm doing a good job of protection,"" said wet market vendor Nie, who said she will continue to disinfect and boil her clothes. ""Even if there is a second wave, I will just stick to it.”

              China, Nepal say Everest a bit higher than past measurements
          
","
              China and Nepal jointly announced a new official height for Mount Everest on Tuesday, ending a discrepancy between the two nations.
        ","
                  Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/china-nepal-say-everest-a-bit-higher-than-past-measurements-1.5221438,"KATHMANDU, NEPAL -- 
	China and Nepal jointly announced a new official height for Mount Everest on Tuesday, ending a discrepancy between the two nations.
	The new height of the world's highest peak is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 feet), which is slightly more than Nepal's previous measurement and about four meters (13 feet) higher than China's.
	Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Nepalese counterpart, Pradeep Gyawali, simultaneously pressed buttons during a virtual conference and the new height flashed on the screen.
	The height of Everest, which is on the border between China and Nepal, was agreed on after surveyors from Nepal scaled the peak in 2019 and a Chinese team did the same in 2020.
	There had been debate over the actual height of the peak and concern that it might have shrunk after a major earthquake in 2015. The quake killed 9,000 people, damaged about 1 million structures in Nepal and triggered an avalanche on Everest that killed 19 people at the base camp.
	There was no doubt that Everest would remain the highest peak because the second highest, Mount K2, is only 8,611 metres (28,244 feet) tall.
	Everest's height was first determined by a British team around 1856 as 8,842 metres (29,002) feet.
	But the most accepted height has been 8,848 metres (29,028 feet), which was determined by the Survey of India in 1954.
	In 1999, a National Geographic Society team using GPS technology came up with a height of 8,850 (29,035 feet). A Chinese team in 2005 said it was 8,844.43 metres (29,009 feet) because it did not include the snow cap.
	A Nepal government team of climbers and surveyors scaled Everest in May 2019 and installed GPS and satellite equipment to measure the peak and snow depth on the summit.
	Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Nepal later that year and the leaders of the two countries decided that they should agree on a height.
	A survey team from China then conducted measurements in the spring of 2020 while all other expeditions were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
	Nepal's climbing community welcomed the end of confusion over the mountain's height.
	""This is a milestone in mountaineering history which will finally end the debate over the height and now the world will have one number,"" said Santa Bir Lama, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.
	China's official Xinhua New Agency quoted Xi as saying the two sides are committed to jointly protecting the environment around Everest and co-operating in scientific research.
	For China, the announcement appeared to be as much about politics as geography. China has drawn Nepal ever closer into its orbit with investments in its economy and the building of highways, dams, airports and other infrastructure in the impoverished nation.
	That appears to serve China's interests in reducing the influence of rival India, with which it shares a disputed border, and Nepal's role as a destination for refugee Tibetans.
	The Xinhua report said nothing about the technical aspects but heavily emphasized the joint announcement's geopolitical weight.
	China and Nepal will establish an ""even closer community of a shared future to enrich the countries and their peoples,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying."

              China trade surplus hits record US$75 billion as November exports soar

	China's politically sensitive trade surplus soared to a record US$75.4 billion in November as exports surged 21.1% over a year earlier, propelled by American consumer demand.
	Exports to the United States rose 46% despite lingering tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington, customs data showed Monday.
	Total exports rose to $268 billion, accelerating from October's 11.4% growth. Imports gained 5% to $192.6 billion, up from the previous month's 4.7%.
	Chinese exporters have benefited from the economy's relatively early reopening after the Communist Party declared the coronavirus pandemic under control in March while foreign competitors still are hampered by anti-disease controls.
	“Exports were much stronger than expected in November,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.
	Forecasters say that surge is unlikely to last into 2021 once coronavirus vaccines are rolled out.
	“We expect export performance to be less impressive,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.
	China's global trade surplus for the first 11 months of 2020 is $460 billion, up 21.4% from this time last year, already one of the highest ever recorded.
	Exports to the United States rose to $51.9 billion while imports of American goods gained 33% to $14.6 billion. The trade surplus with the United States swelled 52% over a year earlier to $37.3 billion.
	Beijing promised to buy more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports as part of the “Phase 1” agreement signed in January and aimed at ending a costly tariff battle over Chinese technology ambitions. China fell behind on meeting those commitments earlier in the year but is catching up as demand rebounds.
	The two governments agreed to postpone further planned tariff hikes on each other's goods but most penalties already imposed on billions of dollars of imports stayed in place.
	Chinese imports are growing faster by volume than by value because demand has been chilled by the shutdown of travel and industry, driving prices lower.
	China is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan falls.
	China's economy shrank by 6.8% from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2% in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9% in the three months ending in September.
	Automakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other raw materials. Retail sales are back above pre-virus levels and rose 4.3% over a year earlier in October.
	Also in November, exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 8.6% over a year ago to $37.5 billion while imports of European goods gained 4.5% to $26.2 billion. China's trade surplus with Europe widened by 20% to $11.3 billion."

	Canada's main stock index moved to within two per cent of a record high Monday on gains in the materials and technology sectors.
	Gold and silver prices increased, partly on expectations that U.S. politicians will agree to additional fiscal stimulus, said Angelo Kourkafas, analyst on the investment strategy team at Edward Jones.
	In addition, there are renewed geopolitical concerns about ongoing Brexit negotiations ahead of Wednesday's deadline and the potential for new U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials over the crackdown on Hong Kong.
	The February gold contract was up US$26.00 at US$1,866.00 an ounce and the March copper contract was down 0.8 of a cent at almost US$3.52 a pound.
	Materials rose 2.1 per cent as shares of Oceanagold Corp. surged 31.9 per cent while Kinross Gold Corp. were up 7.5 per cent.
	The improved performance of Canada's technology sector and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite in the U.S. were attributable to worsening coronavirus trends and lockdowns on both sides of the border, Kourkafas said.
	""The focus and the market's attention ... is looking forward for the vaccine potential distribution. And that continues to be the main driver of sentiment,"" he said in an interview.
	Canadian and U.S health regulators are expected to soon grant emergency authorization for at least two vaccines presented by Pfizer and Moderna. A third vaccine has also been developed by AstraZeneca.
	Technology rose 1.3 per cent with shares of Shopify Inc. up 2.9 per cent.
	""We have seen this kind of tug-of-war between vaccine optimism and worsening coronavirus trends and clearly the focus now, especially in the U.S., is turning to the negotiations in Washington.""
	The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 61.38 points to 17,582.35. It hit an intraday high of 17,611.48 that is less than two per cent or 359 points below February's record high.
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 148.47 points at 30,069.79. The S&P 500 index was down 7.16 points at 3,691.96, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was up 55.72 points at 12,519.95.
	The Canadian dollar was unchanged from Friday at 78.12 cents US.
	The January crude contract was down 50 cents at US$45.76 per barrel and the January natural gas contract was down 16.9 cents at nearly US$2.41 per mmBTU.
	Lower prices pushed the energy sector down 0.9 per cent with Tourmaline Oil Corp. off 5.1 per cent. The price fall is attributable to concerns about demand as new restrictions in movement translates into lower demand for travel and a pullback after last week's strong oil price gains.
	""So we're seeing kind of that effect of the renewed restrictions show up in a little bit of a loss of momentum in the economic data. And we expect that to likely persist for the remainder of the year and likely the first quarter of next year,"" said Kourkafas.

	Chinese vaccine company Sinovac announced Monday that it is planning to complete a new facility to double its annual vaccine production capacity to 600 million doses by the end of the year, while also securing a US$500 million investment in a boost to its COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.
	The company is currently conducting the last stage of clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia and is among the frontrunners of China' s vaccine efforts. China has at least five COVID-19 vaccine candidates running late stage clinical trials across more than a dozen countries.
	Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd., a pharmaceutical conglomerate, bought a 15% stake in Sinovac for an investment of $500 million. The funds will allow the company to ""improve our vaccine sales capabilities, expand in Asia markets, develop and access new technologies, and most importantly, accelerate our efforts to help combat the global pandemic,"" Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong said in a statement.
	On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of its experimental vaccine arrived in Indonesia and are expected to be approved for use soon.
	Sinovac's candidate is a two-dose inactivated vaccine, an old-school technology in which a live virus is killed and then purified. It can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F), within the range of a normal refrigerator, unlike some other vaccines candidates that require far lower temperatures.
	Sinovac's experimental vaccine is currently approved for emergency use in China, although it has not yet obtained final market approval. Under emergency use, it has been distributed to groups the Chinese government deemed suitable, including front-line medical workers and border personnel.
	The latest public data from the company, published in the science journal Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who have recovered from COVID-19."

Chinese probe orbiting moon with Earth-bound samples
          
","
              A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.

	A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.
	The ascent module of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft transferred a container with 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of samples after docking with the robot spacecraft on Sunday and was then cut free.
	The orbiter and reentry vehicle will circle the moon for another week awaiting a narrow time window to make the roughly three-day, 383,000-kilometre (238,000-mile) journey back to Earth. It will first ""bounce"" off the Earth's atmosphere to slow its speed before the reentry vehicle separates and floats down on parachutes to land on the vast steppes of Inner Mongolia, where China's Shenzhou crewed spaceships have also made their landings.
	If the mission succeeds, it will make China the third country after the United States and former Soviet Union to bring moon rocks to Earth. They will be the first fresh samples of the lunar surface obtained by scientists since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 probe in 1976.
	The Chang'e 5 ascent stage blasted off from the moon's surface on Friday, leaving behind the lander module flying the Chinese flag, according to the China National Space Agency, which also released a photo taken by the orbiter showing it approaching for its rendezvous with the ascender, a sliver of the Earth seen in the background.
	That marked the first time China had succeeded in lifting off a spacecraft from a celestial body, while no country had previously achieved the tricky feat of executing a robotic docking in lunar orbit. Controllers on Earth had to deal with distance and time lag while precisely manoeuvring a clamp into position with almost no room for error.
	The 23-day mission has been front page news in state media for days, paired with reports that China has officially lifted all of its citizens out of the most grinding form of poverty. Along with being a propaganda coup for the ruling Communist Party, the dual stories illustrate the vast economic and technological advances China has made since it became just the third country in history to launch a person into space in 2003.
	Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying praised the ""courage to explore, overcome difficulties and pay hard efforts"" of those who made the mission possible.
	""The entirety of the Chinese people are proud of the efforts and wisdom of the Chinese lunar exploration researchers,"" Hua told reporters Monday at a daily briefing.
	By way of cautious incremental steps, China is now in the midst of a series of ambitious missions that include a probe en route to Mars and the development of a reusable space plane about which little information has been provided.
	The Chang'e lunar program, named after the ancient Chinese moon goddess, has also been operating the Chang'e 4 probe on the moon's less explored far side for the past two years, while the Chang'e 3 rover launched seven years ago continues to send back data.
	Future plans call for returning a human to the moon five decades after American astronauts, along with a possible permanent moon base, although no timeline has been offered. China is also building a permanent space station to begin operating as early as 2022.
	U.S. opposition has prevented China's secretive, military-backed program from participating in the International Space Station, although the CNSA has been expanding its ties with other programs, including the European Space Agency, which has helped guide Chang'e 5 on its mission.
	Chang'e 5 touched down Dec. 1 on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side close to a formation called the Mons Rumker, an area believed to have been the site of ancient volcanic activity.
	The rocks and other debris were obtained both by drilling into the moon's crust and by scooping directly off the surface. They are thought to possibly be billions of years younger than those brought back earlier and may offer insights into the moon's history as well as that of other bodies in our solar system.
	The lunar exploration program has set up dedicated labs to analyze the samples for age and composition. China is also expected to share some part of them with other countries, as was done with the hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of rocks, sand, dust and other samples obtained by the U.S. and the former Soviet Union."

	Almost two years after Meng Wanzhou’s arrest in Vancouver's airport, the Huawei executive could be heading home soon.
	According to reports from the Wall Street Journal, the United States Department of Justice is ready to make a deal with the telecom giant, offering Meng a deferred prosecution agreement and allow her to return to China in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing in her ongoing criminal case.
	This could be welcome news for Canada, as Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been detained in China since Meng’s arrest, in what has widely been seen as retaliation from the Chinese government. Canada has also been subject to trade sanctions on canola, soybean, beef, and pork exports, leading to a 16 per cent decline of exports to China in 2019.
	""If she is returned, it opens the door for releasing the two Canadians, and I think that Ottawa is probably busy speaking with Washington and Beijing to try and make sure the solution will be a triangular one,"" said former Canadian ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques.
	However, experts are divided on how soon the Michaels will come home, or if they’ll be released in exchange at all.
	""The idealist in me says perhaps, but the realist says no,"" former diplomat Colin Robertson told CTV News.
	Robertson said this potential deal is only the first step as negotiations with China are always a long process.
	""We look at negotiations through different ends of the telescope and that can lead to misunderstandings,"" he said. ""It can also lead to false optimism, which is I'm afraid we might be encouraging right now.""
	One issue complicating the return of the Michaels is the consistent denial from the Chinese that their detentions were related to Meng's arrest, said Robertson.
	In June, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference: ""The Meng Wanzhou incident is in essence difference from the cases of the Canadians.""
	According to Zhao, ""the United States aims to oppress Huawei and other Chinese high-tech companies, and Canada is its accomplice.""
	""This is really between the United States and Ms. Meng,"" said Charles Burton, associate professor at Brock University and MacDonald-Laurier Institute senior fellow.
	""Would the Chinese authorities release Kovrig and Spavor, or would they continue to hold them to continue to exert pressure over Canada with regard to other political matters?""
	Though China has said in the past Meng's release ""could open up space"" to resolve Kovrig and Spavor's detention, the reports of the potential deal so far do not include any guarantees for the Canadians' return.
	""That's why we have to try and get as much undertakings from the Americans if they do decide to proceed down this road…that the Michaels are part of it,"" said Robertson.
	While it was U.S. President Donald Trump who issued Meng's extradition request, the incoming Biden administration is expected to remain tough on China. Robertson said the Canadian government needs to continue to press the Americans to make sure Kovrig and Spavor aren't forgotten once the Meng affair is resolved.
	""We've been left holding the bag,"" said Robertson.
	""We've been used by the Americans and we've certainly been abused by the Chinese, and the two Michaels are the real victims in this whole tragedy."""

              Negotiating contracts for vaccines in development needed flexibility: Anand
          
","
              Procurement Minister Anita Anand says that as soon as she knows when the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Canada, she will share that information with Canadians.

	Procurement Minister Anita Anand says that as soon as she knows when the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Canada, she will share that information with Canadians.
	But Anand told The Canadian Press in an interview this week that the original contracts to buy COVID-19 vaccines had to be vague about delivery dates because nobody knew at the time if the vaccines would be successful.
	It's only in the last few weeks, when the leading candidates from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca reported such positive results from their large clinical trials, that the way forward became clear enough for Anand's department to start asking the companies to be more specific about when they can make good on their contracts with Canada.
	""We put these contracts in place in order to place Canadians in the best stead possible, of any country in the world, recognizing that we would need to negotiate additional terms such as precise delivery dates, once a vaccine was discovered, and regulatory approval was obtained,"" she said. ""And that is what's happening now.""
	As Canadians face a pandemic-plagued holiday season and dream that 2021 will not be the anxiety-laden and often tragic disaster that 2020 has proven to be, there is one gleaming hope dangling still just out of reach: a vaccine for COVID-19.
	Still, the federal government has yet to answer one big question: When will it get here?
	It is not that she doesn't want to tell Canadians when, said Anand. But the complexities of figuring out a specific date are linked to when Health Canada approves the vaccine, and when the vaccine makers can see that Canada is ready to receive and safely distribute the precious doses, some of which have to be stored at temperatures below -70 C.
	Those pieces are starting to converge now.
	Health Canada officials are days, maybe even hours, away from approving the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech for use in Canada.
	Canadians got some more information on the logistics from a briefing of federal officials this week, including that Pfizer will ship its vaccine directly to 14 identified receiving sites in provinces. FedEx and Innomar Strategies were contracted Friday to oversee the delivery of other vaccines from a national receiving site to provinces.
	The National Advisory Committee on Immunization issued refined guidance Friday for who should get the vaccine first, including long-term care residents and workers, and people over the age of 80.
	The materials like syringes, gauze pads and bandages needed to vaccinate millions of people are in place. Ultralow temperature freezers have been purchased and nine new ones have already arrived. Provincial governments are lining up their own task forces.
	""We are going to have vaccines in this country, as expeditiously as possible,"" Anand said.
	Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole has been decrying the lack of clarity from the Liberals about the vaccine plan. A week ago he accused the Liberals of only starting to buy vaccines in a panic this summer after a collaboration with China on a vaccine fell apart.
	The partnership between the National Research Council and China's CanSino Biologics was announced in May to great fanfare. But the doses to be used in a Canadian clinical trial failed to arrive, when the Chinese government -- in the midst of political tensions with Canada -- refused to issue an export permit for them.
	""I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,"" O'Toole said Nov. 29, adding the timeline shows it wasn't until that deal fell apart that Canada ""started getting serious with Pfizer, Moderna, the other options.""
	Anand said that is not the case.
	She said the CanSino deal fell within Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains' portfolio, not her own, and nothing about the project prevented her from negotiating with other companies.
	Her marching orders to negotiate deals with other vaccine makers came weeks earlier. A team of procurement officials in her department was assigned to the file in March, at the same time as those negotiating contracts for medical supplies, personal protective equipment and rapid tests.
	In June, the COVID-19 vaccine task force provided a list of vaccines for Canada to pursue. Anand said talks with manufacturers began in early July. The first deal, with Massachusetts biotech firm Moderna, was struck July 24.
	Canada was first to sign with Moderna. It signed a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech a week later, on Aug. 1. It was the fourth country to do so, after the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan.
	News of trouble on the CanSino deal first appeared in early July when the doses still hadn't been approved for export by China. Canada walked away from the deal at the end of August when it became clear it would not happen.
	By then, Canada had deals with four other vaccine companies, including Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and NovaVax. It added deals with Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca in September and then with Canada's own Medicago the next month.
	Anand said Canada approached every contract with a similar goal -- to get 20 million doses guaranteed, and options to potentially buy more later on. In all, Canada is paying more than $1 billion to the seven vaccine makers for 194 million doses, even if those vaccines never get beyond the experimental stage.
	Another 220 million doses are available if Canada asks for them, a decision that will be made for the vaccines that are proving to be the best. Anand announced Friday another 20 million doses will come to Canada in 2021 from Moderna, for a total of 40 million.

              Bahrain now 2nd nation to grant Pfizer shot emergency use

	The island kingdom of Bahrain said Friday it has become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.
	The state-run Bahrain News Agency made the announcement on Friday night, following an earlier announcement by the United Kingdom on Wednesday, making Britain the first in the world.
	""The confirmation of approval by the National Health Regulatory Authority of the kingdom of Bahrain followed thorough analysis and review undertaken by the authority of all available data,"" the kingdom said on its state-run Bahrain News Agency.
	Bahrain did not say how may vaccines it has purchased, nor when vaccinations would begin. It did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	Pfizer later told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the ""timing of delivery and the volume of doses,"" was confidential and declined to comment.
	""We have developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support effective vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring, Pfizer said. ""Our distribution is built on a flexible just in time system which will ship the frozen vials to the point of vaccination.""
	The immediate challenge for Bahrain would be the conditions in which the vaccine must be kept. They must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit). Bahrain is a Mideast nation that regularly sees temperatures in the summer of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity.
	Bahrain does have a state-owned carrier, Gulf Air, that it could use to transport the vaccines. In the nearby United Arab Emirates, the Dubai-based long-haul carrier Emirates has already said it is preparing its facilities to distribute vaccines at ultra-cold temperatures.
	The vaccine also requires two doses be given three weeks apart.
	Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculate some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine, an ""inactivated"" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it, also is in use in the UAE.
	""The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to the kingdom's national COVID-19 response, which has strongly prioritized protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic,"" said Dr. Mariam al-Jalahma, the CEO of Bahrain's National Health Regulatory Authority.
	BioNTech, which owns the vaccine, said it has so far signed deals to supply 570 million doses worldwide in 2021, with options to deliver 600 million more. It hopes to supply at least 1.3 billion in 2021.
	Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is a small island off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf.
	With a population of 1.6 million, it has reported more than 87,000 cases and 341 deaths, according to the government. Over 85,000 people have recovered from the COVID-19 illness that is caused by the virus.
	The country is also home to a large expatriate population, with many low-paid labourers from southeast Asia living in tight housing. In July, authorities told the AP they had moved 8,000 labourers to new accommodations, disinfected housing and implemented a rule requiring no more than five labourers per room, with about 3 metres (10 feet) of space for each one.
	The Bahraini government says it has conducted over 2 million coronavirus tests across the island. It initially blamed its higher per-capita infection rate on that."

              Trump spy chief labels China biggest threat to freedom since Second World War

	The top U.S. intelligence official stepped up the Trump administration's harsh attacks on Beijing on Thursday, labelling China the biggest threat to democracy and freedom worldwide since the Second World War and saying it was bent on global domination.
	""The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,"" Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said in an opinion article on the Wall Street Journal website.
	Ratcliffe, a former Republican congressman appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump to the top U.S. spy job last spring, said China posed ""the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War Two.""
	He said he had shifted resources within the US$85 billion annual federal budget allocated to intelligence to increase the focus on China.
	Ratcliffe said China's economic espionage approach was threefold: ""Rob, Replicate and Replace.""
	He said the strategy was for Chinese entities to steal American companies' intellectual property, copy it and then supplant U.S. companies in the global market place.
	A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy rejected Ratcliffe's comments as ""fact-distorting"" and hypocritical and said they showed ""the entrenched Cold-War mindset and ideological prejudices of some people on the U.S. side.""
	Beijing has frequently called on U.S. leaders to dial back their rhetoric on China, which it blames on fear of China's growing role in the world.
	Ratcliffe's essay was the latest broadside against China from Trump's administration as it seeks to cement the outgoing president's tough-on-China legacy following his Nov. 3 election defeat.
	Trump's approach has taken relations between the world's two largest economies to their lowest point in decades and analysts say it could limit the incoming Biden administration's room for manoeuvre in dealing with Beijing.
	Ratcliffe alluded to reports collected by U.S. intelligence agencies that Chinese representatives have sought to interfere in U.S. domestic politics.
	He also charged that China had stolen U.S. defense technology to fuel President Xi Jinping's aggressive military modernization plans.
	""The election is over. Now let’s all be honest about China,"" Ratcliffe told Reuters after the article was published.
	Among other issues, Washington and Beijing have clashed over China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, its tightening grip on Hong Kong, its disputed claims in the South China Sea, trade and accusations of human rights crimes in Xinjiang.
	Ratcliffe, who served only briefly on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee before Trump appointed him to his role, has been accused by Democrats and current and former intelligence officials of politicizing intelligence.
	In his essay, Ratcliffe said Chinese authorities had ""conducted human testing"" on members of the Chinese army ""in hopes of developing soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities."" He did not elaborate.
	U.S.-based think tanks have reported that China is giving increasing importance to biotechnology in its military strategy but they have not released detailed reports about the kind of testing alleged by Ratcliffe.
	On Thursday, the Trump administration restricted travel to the United States by members of China's ruling Communist Party and their families.
	On Wednesday, it banned cotton imports from a quasi-military organization in Xinjiang it says uses forced labor of detained Muslims, while the House passed a law to kick Chinese firms off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not comply with auditing rules.
	China accused U.S. politicians of fabricating news of detained Muslims being forced into labor in Xinjiang.
	In an emailed statement, the embassy spokesperson said ""no one deserves the title of Empire of Hacking and Spying better than the U.S."" and charged that both the U.S. government and U.S. firms had long carried out ""large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber theft, surveillance and attack.""
	Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said Ratcliffe's comments appeared aimed at locking in a tough approach before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
	""It does appear to part of a broader effort to tie Biden's hands and limit his room to maneuver on China policy,"" she said.
	""In prior administrations, the norm has been to avoid taking such actions during a presidential transition, but the Trump administration has long set a pattern of bucking the norm."" "

              Astronauts harvest radishes grown aboard the International Space Station

              Astronauts are harvesting fresh radishes grown in space, a delicious prospect that also could help seed food production efforts for longer-term missions to the moon and Mars.

	Astronauts are harvesting fresh radishes grown in space, a delicious prospect that also could help seed food production efforts for longer-term missions to the moon and Mars.
	On Monday, NASA flight engineer Kate Rubins pulled out 20 radish plants grown in the space station's Advanced Plant Habitat, wrapping them in foil for cold storage until they can make the voyage back to Earth next year.
	Radishes are the latest type of fresh produce to be successfully grown and harvested in zero gravity, joining ""Outredgeous"" red romaine lettuce, green lettuce, Chinese cabbage, lentils and mustard, according to a NASA fact sheet.
	""I've worked on APH since the beginning, and each new crop that we're able to grow brings me great joy because what we learn from them will help NASA send astronauts to Mars and bring them back safely,"" said Nicole Dufour, the Advanced Plant Habitat program manager at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, in a news release.
	Back on the ground, scientists at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida are growing radishes in a control group set for harvest on December 15. The researchers will compare the space-grown radishes to the veggies grown on Earth, checking on how space produce measures up on providing the minerals and nutrients astronauts need as they prepare for longer trips.
	Meanwhile, astronauts will repeat the radish experiment in the heavens, planting and harvesting another round of radish crop to give scientists more data to draw from.
	With their short cultivation time, radishes present potential advantages as a food source for future astronauts embarking on deep space missions in years to come. The radishes grow quickly, and they can reach full maturity in 27 days.
	The root vegetables also don't require much maintenance from the crew as they grow.
	""Radishes provide great research possibilities by virtue of their sensitive bulb formation,"" said Karl Hasenstein, a professor of biology at the University of Louisiana and the principal investigator on the project, in a news release.
	Researchers will analyze the effects of carbon dioxide on the radishes as well as how the vegetables acquire and distribute minerals, according to Hasenstein, who has run plant experiments with NASA since 1995.
	Astronauts have grown 15 different types of plants on the station, including eight different types of leafy greens. And NASA has already tested more than 100 crops on Earth, identifying which candidates to try out next in space.
	""Growing a range of crops helps us determine which plants thrive in microgravity and offer the best variety and nutritional balance for astronauts on long-duration missions,"" Dufour said.
	The latest experiments build upon ongoing research growing and harvesting plants in space.
	Researchers at NASA began experiments using its Vegetable Production Systems growth chambers back in 2014 shortly after they were delivered to the space station.
	Some of the early experiments with red romaine lettuce resulted in a paper, published this March in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science, showing that space lettuce was safe to eat.
	In August 2015, NASA shared a video that features American astronauts Dr. Kjell Lindgren and Scott Kelly floating aboard the station, saying ""Cheers"" and eating the space-grown treat.
	""Tastes good,"" Kelly said.
	Lindgren tweeted about how he put his lettuce into a space cheeseburger for dinner.
	Getting space agriculture right matters because the nutrients in the prepackaged food that astronauts currently eat in space degrade over a period of time, NASA said.
	Getting humans to Mars and back safely over a two- or three-year mission requires growing food along the way. That not only gives astronauts more of a vibrant supply of fresh nutrients on the voyage; it also serves an emotional need as they tend to crops that are both a figurative and literal taste of home, according to the agency.
	The NASA Artemis program aims to land the first woman and next man on the moon in 2024, and to establish a sustained presence on the moon by 2028. From there, the agency will be poised to begin staging its next big leap, to Mars.
	But before we make it to the red planet, we've first got to make a tasty green space salad."

	The U.S. government has stepped up a feud with Beijing over security by adding China's biggest processor chip maker and a state-owned oil giant to a blacklist that limits access to American technology and investment.
	Thursday's announcement adds to steps taken by U.S. President Donald Trump against China since losing his re-election bid Nov. 3. Political analysts have said Trump was likely to take further action before President-elect Joe Biden takes office Jan. 20.
	The Pentagon added four companies including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. to a list of entities deemed to be part of efforts to modernize the ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army. That raises the total number of companies on the blacklist to 35.
	SMIC plays a leading role in the ruling party's effort to reduce reliance on U.S. and other foreign technology by creating Chinese suppliers of processor chips and other components.
	China's government has criticized such restrictions as an abuse of national security arguments to handicap fledgling Chinese competitors in technology and other fields.
	That has taken on greater urgency after Washington blocked access to American chips and other technology for telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. and imposed curbs on other Chinese buyers. The White House also has blocked the use of U.S. technology by global vendors to produce chips for Huawei.
	CNOOC is the smallest of China's three main state-owned oil producers.
	Political analysts expect little change in policy under Biden due to widespread frustration with China's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.
	The 2.3 million-member PLA is one of the world's biggest and best-armed militaries. It is spending heavily to develop nuclear submarines, stealth fighters, ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons.
	The Pentagon's first list of 20 companies deemed to be PLA-linked in June included Huawei and video surveillance provider HikVision Digital Technology Co. Both say they never have taken part in military-related research.
	Also cited by the Pentagon in earlier lists are state-owned phone carriers China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Ltd. and petrochemical, construction, aerospace, rocketry, shipbuilding and nuclear power equipment companies."

	A Chinese spacecraft lifted off from the moon Thursday night with a load of lunar rocks, the first stage of its return to Earth, the government space agency reported.
	Chang'e 5, the third Chinese spacecraft to land on the moon and the first to take off from it again, is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious missions for Beijing's space program, which also has a orbiter and rover headed to Mars.
	The Chang'e 5 touched down Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side. Its mission: collect about 2 kilograms (4 pounds) of lunar rocks and bring them back to Earth, the first return of samples since Soviet spacecraft did so in the 1970s. Earlier, the U.S. Apollo astronauts brought back hundreds of pounds of moon rocks.
	The landing site is near a formation called the Mons Rumker and may contain rocks billions of years younger than those retrieved earlier.
	The ascent vehicle lifted off from the moon shortly after 11 p.m. Beijing time Thursday (1500 GMT) and was due to rendezvous with a return vehicle in lunar orbit, then transfer the samples to a capsule, according to the China National Space Administration. The moon rocks and debris were sealed inside a special canister to avoid contamination.
	It wasn't clear when the linkup would occur. After the transfer, the ascent module would be ejected and the capsule would remain in lunar orbit for about a week, awaiting the optimal time to make the trip back to Earth.
	Chinese officials have said the capsule with the samples is due to land on Earth around the middle of the month. Touchdown is planned for the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, where China's astronauts have made their return in Shenzhou spacecraft.
	Chang'e 5's lander, which remained on the moon, was capable of scooping samples from the surface and drilling 2 metres (about 6 feet).
	While retrieving samples was its main task, the lander also was equipped to extensively photograph the area, map conditions below the surface with ground penetrating radar and analyze the lunar soil for minerals and water content.
	Right before the ascent vehicle lifted off, the lander unfurled what the space administration called the first free-standing Chinese flag on the moon. The agency posted an image -- apparently taken from the lander -- of the ascend vehicle firing its engines as it took off.
	Chang'e 5 has revived talk of China one day sending astronauts to the moon and possibly building a scientific base there, although no timeline has been proposed for such projects.
	China launched its first temporary orbiting laboratory in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station after 2022, possibly to be serviced by a reusable space plane.
	While China is boosting co-operation with the European Space Agency and others, interactions with NASA are severely limited by U.S. concerns over the secretive nature and close military links of the Chinese program."

	Early next year, a Chinese businessman named Gan Xianbing will be sentenced in a Chicago courtroom for laundering just over US$530,000 in Mexican cartel drug money.
	Gan, 50, was convicted in February of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transfer business that whisked cartel cash from U.S. drug sales offshore. Gan has maintained his innocence; his lawyers say he was entrapped by U.S. authorities. The trial garnered few headlines and little of the public fascination reserved for kingpins of powerful narcotics syndicates that U.S. federal prosecutors said Gan served.
	Still, U.S. law enforcement officials told Reuters that Chinese ""money brokers"" such as Gan represent one of the most worrisome new threats in their war on drugs. They say small cells of Chinese criminals have upended the way narcotics cash is laundered and are displacing the Mexican and Colombian money men that have long dominated the trade.
	Virtually unheard of a decade ago, these Chinese players are moving vast sums quickly and quietly, authorities said. Their expertise: routing cartel drug profits from the United States to China then on to Mexico with a few clicks of a burner phone and Chinese banking apps – and without the bulky cash ever crossing borders. The launderers pay small Chinese-owned businesses in the United States and Mexico to help them move the funds. Most contact with the banking system happens in China, a veritable black hole for U.S. and Mexican authorities.
	Chinese money brokers based in Mexico ""have come to dominate international money laundering markets,"" U.S. prosecutors said in a Sept. 24 sentencing memorandum for Gan's case.
	Reuters spoke to more than a dozen law enforcement officials, diplomats, lawyers and sources familiar with the Gan case or Chinese money laundering techniques. The news organization also examined more than 1,500 pages of documents from the trial. The material included previously unreported details about how the ring operated compiled by prosecutors and agents of Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that led the probe.
	What emerged was a blueprint showing how some groups of Chinese money brokers have become key cogs in the multi-billion-dollar drug empires run by Latin American cartels. The Chinese role presents a formidable challenge for U.S. anti-narcotics efforts at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.
	Gan, who U.S. prosecutors said operated a tight ring with another Chinese money broker, was apprehended in November 2018 by Homeland Security Investigations agents at Los Angeles International Airport on his way to Mexico from Hong Kong. The U.S. government said that Gan had moved anywhere from $25 million to $65 million in illicit drug proceeds from 2016 to the time of his arrest, according to a September court filing by Gan's attorneys.
	Based in Guadalajara, the ring is believed to have worked with multiple syndicates, including the famed Sinaloa Cartel that was previously led by jailed Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to two U.S.-based sources familiar with the investigation.
	The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Europol, the European Union's law enforcement arm, have warned about the expanding web of Chinese crime groups laundering drug money. Europol in November 2019 said these groups present a ""growing threat to Europe,"" while the U.S. Treasury in February placed Chinese professional money laundering networks on its list of ""key threats"" and vulnerabilities within the U.S. financial system.
	U.S. law enforcement has stepped up operations against these groups. In addition to the Gan case in Illinois, federal prosecutors have brought charges in Virginia and Oregon against alleged members of at least two other Chinese money laundering rings since October of last year. Those cases are pending.
	Still, a senior U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent said U.S. efforts to nail Latin American drug capos by following the money have gotten much more difficult.
	""I can't emphasize this enough, the involvement of the Chinese has really complicated all of these schemes,"" the DEA official said.
	Gan, who declined to testify in court, pleaded not guilty to three counts of money laundering, one count of conspiracy to launder money and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was acquitted on the conspiracy charge. Reuters did not receive a reply to requests for comment from Gan sent to his legal team.
	His lawyers, in a September sentencing plea document, said Gan was not the mastermind of the operation, rather a seafood exporter who was duped into letting his bank account in China be used to launder money by another Mexico-based Chinese national named Pan Haiping. Glenn Seiden, Gan's lawyer, declined to speak with Reuters or answer questions about Gan's case.
	Attorney Aaron Schwartz, who was part of the defense team, said he wanted to make it clear that Gan did not cooperate with the U.S. government because his client feared for the safety of his family in Guadalajara, where the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel holds sway. Gan's lawyers also allege Gan was entrapped in a sting operation by Homeland Security Investigations agents working with an informant who helped arrange the transactions that resulted in their client's conviction. The agency said it does not comment on ongoing investigations.
	Pan Haiping, Gan's alleged associate, was detained earlier this year in Mexico on accusations of money laundering and is awaiting extradition to the United States, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and a senior Mexican federal police source. Pan Haiping could not be reached for comment. The Mexican prosecutor's office declined to comment on Pan Haiping's case or provide the name of his legal counsel in Mexico, saying it cannot comment on ongoing cases.
	In a March 2019 U.S. indictment unsealed a few weeks ago, Pan Haiping was charged with laundering almost $500,000 for Mexican cartels; running an illegal money transmitting business in Illinois; and conspiring to launder money using bank accounts in China, including an account belonging to Gan.
	Another alleged conspirator, Long Huanxin, was arrested in February at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian law enforcement acting on a warrant from U.S. authorities, according to Canadian court transcripts from Long's detention hearing. Long was extradited to the United States, and last month he pleaded not guilty in Chicago to charges of money laundering for Mexican cartels, U.S. court documents show. Long's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
	U.S officials informally sought assistance from China in the Gan case but received no support in their investigation, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the probe.
	China's Foreign Ministry disputed their account. The ministry told Reuters in late October that it did not receive a request from U.S. authorities for help on that case. China stands ready to cooperate with the United States to ""destroy drug cartels and drug-related money-laundering networks,"" the ministry said in a statement. But it stressed the need for the two countries to work on the ""principle of respecting each other's laws, equality and mutual benefit,"" the statement said.
	The ministry said most Chinese bank-account holders about whom Washington has inquired as part of its money laundering investigations in recent years were ""legitimate enterprises and individuals"" in China. ""After we asked the U.S. side to provide drug-related clues or evidence of enterprises and individuals, the U.S. side has not responded,"" China's Foreign Ministry said in the statement.
	Without help from Beijing to track money flows in China and to infiltrate the laundering networks, U.S. agents say they face an uphill struggle to catch culprits.
	""It's the most sophisticated form of money laundering that's ever existed,"" one of the U.S. sources familiar with the investigation said.
	Key to cracking the case was Lim Seok Pheng, a New York-based member of the ring who became a cooperating witness for the U.S. government following her May 2018 arrest on suspicion of money laundering.
	A Singapore national, Lim said at Gan's trial that she once peddled footwear and had first met Gan in China where he ran a shoe factory before he relocated to Guadalajara in 2011. Lim testified that Gan recruited her to join the illicit operation in 2016 and that she became lovers with the other alleged ringleader, Pan Haiping.
	Following her arrest at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, Lim agreed to wear a recording device to help authorities gather evidence against Gan and the other alleged conspirators. She also brought undercover Homeland Security Investigations agents into the operation as money couriers on three separate cash pick-ups in Chicago that led to Gan's conviction, according to the trial testimony of Lim and the agents.
	Lim pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in November 2019 and is out on bail, awaiting sentencing.
	She and her attorney declined to comment.
	The only thing tougher than moving illegal drugs across borders is getting the profits back to Mexico's cartels, U.S. officials said. Cash is heavy, and transporting it exposes traffickers to lots of risk. Putting it into the banking system is perilous, too. The U.S. and Mexican financial systems have been geared to detect dirty money.
	Prosecutors told the court that Gan and his accomplices sidestepped these obstacles by first moving the U.S. cash offshore to China, then on to Mexico. Lim was a linchpin connecting both sides of the Pacific. In her November 2019 plea agreement, Lim admitted to laundering, with Gan and Pan Haiping, about $48 million in drug cash between 2016 and September 2017. She took a 0.5% commission, the agreement said.
	Lim testified at Gan's trial that she had two jobs. The first was collecting drug money in U.S. cities such as Chicago and New York from cartel contacts, typically anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million at a time. She would wait in a public place, armed with a burner phone, a code name and the serial number of an authentic $1 bill. Mexican cartels would pass on her details to their dealer contacts, who would call Lim's burner phone and use the code name to identify themselves. At the rendezvous point, Lim would give them the $1 bill with the corresponding serial number as a ""receipt"" to verify the handoff had taken place, Lim said at trial.
	Lim's other job was recruiting businesses in the Chinese diaspora to help them make that cash disappear, Lim and prosecutors said.
	Some U.S.-based Chinese merchants have long engaged in off-the-books currency ""swaps"" to avoid hefty bank fees. Such transactions are illegal in the United States, American authorities said, if they are used by companies routinely to skirt the formal banking system or to operate an unauthorized money transfer business. In some cases these informal, hawala-style transactions are used to help wealthy Chinese move money clandestinely out of China, in violation of that nation's currency controls.
	The operation run by Gan and Pan Haiping grew to include at least three Chinese merchants in New York, who were paid commissions to participate, Lim told the court. The names of the Chinese merchants were not revealed at Gan's trial, and it's unclear if they knew of Lim's links to drug trafficking.
	Prosecutors at trial presented testimony, evidence and graphics showing how the transactions worked. At their simplest, authorities said, that process worked as follows: Lim would arrive at one of the merchants with, say, $150,000 in cartel cash. With the businessperson observing, she would open a currency converter app on her smartphone to obtain the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan. She would also hand over the details of a bank account in China given to her by Gan. In what's known as a ""mirror transaction,"" the Chinese businessperson would take possession of the $150,000 in U.S. currency while simultaneously transferring the equivalent in Chinese yuan from their own account in China to the bank account number provided by Gan.
	The result was that a foreign transfer of funds had been made without involving a U.S financial institution - or the accompanying digital fingerprints. The Chinese business had effectively used yuan from its China-based bank account to purchase cash dollars now on hand in the United States; it earned a commission for its trouble while avoiding bank fees and U.S. government scrutiny.
	Meanwhile, Gan had converted U.S. drug dollars into Chinese currency now sitting in a Chinese bank. The only contact with the financial system – a domestic transfer between two accounts in China – would be unlikely to raise red flags with Chinese banking authorities unaware of the money's provenance.
	The crime ring used various Chinese banks for the operations, including the Bank of China, according to WhatsApp messages exchanged between Gan and Pan Haiping. The messages were extracted from Gan's iPhone by Homeland Security Investigations agents after his arrest, and key excerpts were read out aloud by prosecutors at trial, according to court transcripts.
	Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.
	To get the money from China to Mexico, Gan performed the same sort of mirror transactions, only this time with the help of Chinese businesses who had access to pesos in Mexico. This leg of the journey was described by the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and is outlined in court documents, including the U.S. government's September 2020 sentencing memorandum for Gan and the June 2019 superseding indictment detailing charges against him.
	U.S. prosecutors said the laundered money was delivered to Pan Haiping's Mexican drug cartel clients, according to the superseding indictment. No Mexican banks were named in any of the court documents reviewed by Reuters.
	In October, Reuters traveled to Guadalajara and found Gan's wife, Pan Emi (no relation to Pan Haiping), working in a busy store she owns in the city's Chinese quarter selling wigs, plastic jewelry, sunglasses and other low-cost merchandise imported from China.
	Manning the cash register, Pan Emi said her husband was innocent of wrongdoing and being unfairly portrayed by authorities as a criminal when he was nothing more than a plucky businessman. She said no Mexican or U.S. law enforcement agents had contacted her about the case.
	She said Gan, fed up with high Chinese taxes, had left his shoe factory in the Chinese city of Wenzhou nearly a decade ago seeking a better life in Mexico. In Guadalajara, she said, Gan co-founded a business exporting jellyfish, which are considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac in China. Pan Emi said her ""super friendly"" husband built a large network of friends and contacts in Mexico and was always on the phone.
	Pan Emi confirmed some details of the case. She said her husband knew Pan Haiping and Lim and had participated in currency swaps with other Chinese merchants. But she denied Gan was involved with traffickers or knew anything about drug money.
	She said currency swaps were common in the expatriate Chinese business community to avoid pricey fees and lousy exchange rates offered by banks.
	""These swaps that we do with each other are easy. It's no big problem,"" Pan Emi said. ""I don't think it's illegal.""
	Money brokers like Gan and Pan Haiping are growing in number among the large Chinese diasporas in the United States, Europe and Latin America, according to three DEA officials.
	Demand for their services is being driven by affluent Chinese looking to evade China's currency controls and move wealth abroad, the DEA officials told Reuters. Beijing limits the amount of money its citizens can transfer out of China to the equivalent of $50,000 U.S. dollars annually.
	Latin American cartels, flush with dollars and euros from drug sales, are uniquely placed to satisfy the Chinese appetite for hard currencies. Some Chinese expatriates located in drug-producing countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Peru are the intermediaries bridging these disparate sets of people, said Donald Im, a senior DEA agent and anti-money laundering specialist.
	""When there is need by the cartels for cash to be laundered, and there is demand for cash from the Chinese, you have a perfect marriage made in heaven,"" Im told Reuters. ""The Chinese brokers are very important to the Mexican and Colombian cartels.""
	In the case of Gan, it was a lucrative business, according to conversations between his alleged associates taped by Homeland Security Investigations agents. ""He has made $1 million already because of us, for real,"" Pan Haiping told Lim in August 2017, according to transcripts of intercepted phone communications presented at Gan's trial.
	Chinese money launderers are squeezing out Mexican and Colombian rivals by undercutting them on price by as much as half, U.S. officials said. The Chinese operators have been able to do that because they levy fees on both sides of each transaction. They impose fat commissions as high as 10% on Chinese citizens eager to get money out of China. That allows the Chinese money brokers, in turn, to charge traffickers nominal fees of just a few percentage points. The money launderers still turn a handsome profit while locking in a steady supply of coveted dollars and euros from cartel customers.
	DEA agent Im said the Chinese expats had the ""systems and the infrastructure"" in place not only to launder the drug proceeds but to do it so cheaply that drug cartels receive back ""almost 100%"" of their dirty money.
	Chinese money brokers have also managed to avoid choosing sides in Mexico's cartel wars, even coordinating money contracts with both the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels on the same day, according to a second senior DEA agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	Traffickers use other so-called trade-based money laundering schemes to move drug money from China to Mexico, according to the DEA and Mexican government officials who spoke with Reuters. In July, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit, an investigative agency, said publicly that Chinese nationals laundering money for the Jalisco New Generation cartel were using drug proceeds to buy shoes in bulk from China, then reselling them in Mexico to get the gang their cash.
	Chinese exports to Mexico, including electronics, clothing and other consumer goods, have nearly doubled over the past decade to $83 billion in 2019. The surge has allowed drug cartels and their money launderers to piggyback on this burgeoning trade relationship, authorities said.
	In Guadalajara, Pan Emi said e-mail exchanges with her husband's U.S. lawyers left her optimistic ahead of Gan's looming sentencing. Prosecutors have asked for a 20-year jail term; Gan's defense attorneys have argued for no more than two years.
	Pan Emi said business was going well in Mexico and she had no desire to return to China. ""I hope my husband comes back,"" she said."

              China hits out at U.S. after report of new visa restrictions
          
","
              China on Thursday accused critics in the U.S. government of ""an escalation of political suppression"" against Beijing following a report of new visa restrictions on members of China's ruling Communist Party and their immediate family members.
        ","
                  Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/china-hits-out-at-u-s-after-report-of-new-visa-restrictions-1.5215115,"BEIJING -- 
	China on Thursday accused critics in the U.S. government of ""an escalation of political suppression"" against Beijing following new visa restrictions on members of China's ruling Communist Party and their immediate family members.
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China would ""make representations"" to the U.S. over its decision to limit such people to one-month, single-entry visas.
	Hua called Washington's approach ""totally inconsistent with the U.S.'s own interests,"" and said it would damage America's global image.
	""I think it is obvious to all that this is an escalation of political suppression by some extreme anti-China forces in the U.S. out of strong ideological prejudice and deep-rooted Cold War mentality against China,"" Hua said at a daily briefing.
	The State Department said in a statement Thursday that the new restrictions are intended to protect the U.S. from the Chinese Communist Party's ""malign influence.""
	""For decades we allowed the CCP free and unfettered access to U.S. institutions and businesses while these same privileges were never extended freely to U.S. citizens in China,"" it said.
	It wasn't clear how the restrictions would be enforced since many of the party's 92 million members do not play active public roles in its institutions.
	The restrictions are the latest punitive measure taken against China's leadership and economy amid sharpening disputes over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Taiwan and a host of other issues.
	On Wednesday, the U.S. said it would block imports from a major Chinese producer of cotton goods because of its reliance on workers detained as part of a crackdown on ethnic minorities in China's northwest.
	Washington has already slapped travel bans and financial sanctions on officials connected to the crackdown on Uighurs and other Chinese Muslim groups in Xinjiang, as well as on Chinese and Hong Kong officials it accuses of restricting social and political rights in the semi-autonomous Chinese city through the implementation of a harsh new national security law.
	Diplomatic ties hit a low point over the summer when the U.S. ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston and China responded by demanding the U.S. vacate its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.
	Washington had been loosening restrictions on travel by Chinese to the U.S., seeking to take advantage of the lavish spending habits of China's newly wealthy. Beginning in 2014, Chinese travellers -- whether party members or not -- became eligible for multiple-entry visas valid for 10 years, with stays of 180 days allowed for each entry, while students were permitted visas good for five years. China reciprocated with similar treatment for U.S. citizens.
	Chinese who make up the single largest group of foreign students at American universities have already complained of tougher conditions for obtaining or extending visas. Chinese academics have also faced greater scrutiny, while dozens of journalists with state media have been forced to return home and visa restrictions placed on those remaining, prompting retaliation from Beijing.
	Analysts have long speculated that President Donald Trump will impose harsher measures on China before leaving office on Jan. 20, placing President-elect Joe Biden in a bind in managing the increasingly fractious relationship.

              Phishing ploy targets COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort
          
","
              IBM security researchers say they have detected a cyberespionage effort using targeted phishing emails to try to collect vital information on the World Health Organization's initiative for distributing COVID-19 vaccine to developing countries.
        ","
                  Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/phishing-ploy-targets-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-effort-1.5215096,"BOSTON -- 
	IBM security researchers say they have detected a cyberespionage effort using targeted phishing emails to try to collect vital information on the World Health Organization's initiative for distributing COVID-19 vaccine to developing countries.
	The researchers said they could not be sure who was behind the campaign, which began in September, or if it was successful. But the precision targeting and careful efforts to leave no tracks bore ""the potential hallmarks of nation-state tradecraft,"" they said in a blog post Thursday.
	The campaign's targets, in countries including Germany, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan, are likely associated with the development of the ""cold chain"" needed to ensure coronavirus vaccines get the nonstop sterile refrigeration they need to be effective for the nearly 3 billion people who live where temperature-controlled storage is insufficient, IBM said.
	""Think of it as the bloodline that will be supplying the most vital vaccines globally,"" said Claire Zaboeva, an IBM analyst involved in the detection.
	Whoever is behind the operation could be motivated by a desire to learn how the vaccines are best able to be shipped and stored -- the entire refrigeration process -- in order to copy it, said Nick Rossmann, the IBM team's global threat intelligence lead. Or they might want to be able to undermine a vaccine's legitimacy or launch a disruptive or destructive attack, he added.
	In the ploy, executives with groups likely associated with the initiative known as Covax -- created by the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization and other UN agencies -- were sent spoofed emails appearing to come from an executive of Haier Biomedical, a Chinese company considered the world's main cold-chain supplier, the analyst said.
	The phishing emails had malicious attachments that prompted recipients to enter credentials that could have been used to harvest sensitive information about partners vital to the vaccine-delivery platform.
	Targets included the European Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union and companies that make solar panels for powering portable vaccine refrigerators. Other targets were petrochemical companies, likely because they produce dry ice, which is used in the cold chain, Zaboeva said.
	The EU agency has been busy revising new import and export regimes for coronavirus vaccines and would be a gold mine for hackers seeking stepping stones into partnering organizations, she said.
	Covax has struggled to raise enough money to compete for vaccine contracts against the world's wealthiest nations in the race to secure doses as fast as they can be produced. But the UN and Gavi have invested millions in cold-chain equipment across Africa and Asia. The investment, in the works well before the pandemic, was accelerated to prepare for an eventual global rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
	Whoever was behind the phishing operation likely sought ""advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy,"" the blog post said. Coronavirus vaccines will be one of the world's most sought-after products as they are distributed, so theft may also be a danger.
	Last month, Microsoft said it had detected mostly unsuccessful attempts by state-backed Russian and North Korean hackers to steal data from leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers. It gave no information on how many succeeded or how serious those breaches were. Chinese state-backed hackers have also targeted vaccine makers, the U.S. government said in announcing criminal charges in July.
	Microsoft said most of the targets -- located in Canada, France, India, South Korea and the United States -- were researching vaccines and COVID-19 treatments. It did not name the targets.
	On Wednesday, Britain became the first to country to authorize a rigorously tested COVID-19 vaccine, the one developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech.
	Other countries aren't far behind: Regulators not only in the U.S. but in the European Union and Canada also are vetting the Pfizer vaccine along with a shot made by Moderna Inc. British and Canadian regulators are also considering a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
	The logistical challenges of distributing vaccines globally are huge. The Pfizer-BioNTech one must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).

              China testing blunders stemmed from secret deals with firms
          
","
              China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, according to an Associated Press investigation.
        ","
                  Thursday, Dec. 3, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/china-testing-blunders-stemmed-from-secret-deals-with-firms-1.5215035,"WUHAN, CHINA -- 
	Secrecy and cronyism at China's top disease control agency led to widespread test shortages and flaws that hampered the early response to the coronavirus outbreak, an Associated Press investigation has found.
	China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, according to the investigation. It was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails.
	The Shanghai companies -- GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology -- paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. The price: One million RMB (US$146,600) each, the sources said. It's unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.
	In the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. They took control of patient samples and made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated.
	The flawed testing system -- at a time when the virus could have been slowed -- stopped scientists and officials from seeing how fast it was spreading. Chinese authorities failed to report a single new case between Jan. 5 and 17, even as hundreds were infected in Wuhan, the city where the virus was first detected.
	The apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public or barring large gatherings. It also caused critical shortages of testing kits, barring access to care for many who were infected.
	The testing problems, along with other mistakes and delays, allowed the virus to rip through Wuhan undetected and spread across the world in a pandemic that has now sickened 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.
	China was hardly the only country to grapple with testing. In in the U.S., the CDC declined to use a WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and led to even longer delays than in China. Still, the hiccups in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus.
	""Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.""
	China's foreign ministry and China's top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to requests for comment.
	But interviews and documents suggest that a culture of backdoor connections quietly flourished in a top-down, underfunded public health system. Though none of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits were well-known in the industry, there were extensive ties between the companies and top China CDC researchers.
	The founder of BioGerm, Zhao Baihui, was the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC's microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm's predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC. In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars' worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary. After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao went on to spearhead lucrative contracts with Shanghai officials.
	Zhao did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.
	Another of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China's cabinet. In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal CDC training conference on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits.
	GeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.
	The last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. In an interview, CEO Li Hui said the CDC routinely contracted his company to make emergency testing chemicals. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.
	""We've been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it's normal,"" Li said.
	It's unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law.
	They raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
	But other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under special laws on the procurement of emergency goods during natural disasters.
	""Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,"" said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law. ""I wouldn't be so quick to rush to judgement.""
	The first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests.
	In past outbreaks, the China CDC sent test designs and testing compounds to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen. But this time, they held back the genome and test designs. Instead, they finalized ""technology transfer"" agreements to give the test designs to the Shanghai companies, according to three people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret.
	At the same time, central CDC authorities stymied others from testing. Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. As a result, for weeks, local CDC staff were unable to confirm new cases.
	After a Jan. 14 internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, China's health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again.
	But the test kits from GeneoDx and Huirui had quality issues, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives. And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.
	As a result, in the early days, getting a COVID test was so difficult that Wuhan residents compared it to winning the lottery.
	Among the victims was Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher who started coughing on Jan. 23. When he went to the hospital, he waited for eight hours, only to be turned away for a lack of test kits. Then, when he finally got tested on Jan. 30, it turned out negative, even as the virus ravaged his lungs.
	His second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.
	""There were very, very few tests, basically none -- if you couldn't prove you were positive, you couldn't get admitted to a hospital,"" his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October. ""The doctor said there was nothing that could be done."""

	A diplomatic war of words between Australia and China over a graphic tweet seemed to finally cool on Thursday as Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison struck a much more conciliatory tone.
	Morrison's change in approach came even after he was thwarted in getting his views out directly to Chinese people over the messaging app WeChat, after the Chinese company deleted his post on the grounds it could distort historical events and confuse the public.
	Earlier this week, Morrison expressed indignation and anger at the tweet posted by a Chinese official that showed a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.
	The post took aim at alleged unlawful killings and abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.
	Earlier this week, Morrison called the tweet ""truly repugnant"" and ""deeply offensive"" and demanded an apology from China. But China had not backed down, saying that Australia should be the one examining its actions.
	On Thursday, Morrison took a much different approach, telling reporters in Canberra that his aim was for the two countries to have a ""happy coexistence.""
	""My position and my government's position is to seek constructive engagement,"" Morrison said. ""The relationship with China is a mutually beneficial one. It supports both our countries, it is good for both of our countries.""
	China is Australia's largest trading partner.
	Morrison said Australia had made its views very clear on both the tweet and the WeChat message.
	WeChat is ubiquitous in China and is used for everything from getting news to making electronic payments. The company is held responsible for ensuring content doesn't attract negative attention, and censorship is relatively common.
	Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he was disappointed about both the tweet and the deleted post.
	""What the prime minister did in his WeChat message before it was disappointingly deleted was he made it very clear Australia is proud of its service men and women who wear the uniform,"" Frydenberg said.
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

	Australia's economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, rebounding from its first recession in nearly three decades as it recovered from pandemic-related shocks, according to figures released Wednesday.
	Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters the country still has a lot of ground to make up from the coronavirus downturn.
	""Australia's recession may be over, but Australia's economic recovery is not,"" he said.
	Despite the latest quarterly rise, the economy contracted at a 3.8% annual pace. That's after GDP fell by 0.3% in the first quarter and then by a record 7% in the second quarter.
	""But the Australian economy has demonstrated its remarkable resilience and Australia is as well positioned as any other nation on Earth,"" Frydenberg said. ""Today's national accounts represent a major step forward in Australia's economic recovery.""
	Before this year, Australia had managed to avoid a recession for 28 years. The economy grew even during the global financial crisis thanks to strong demand for Australia's mineral exports and a robust domestic sector.
	The better-than-expected figures were encouraging, economists said.
	""The rebound in Q3 GDP reversed around 40% of the decline during the first half of the year and we expect output to return to pre-virus levels by mid-2021,"" Ben Udy of Capital Economics said in a commentary.
	Now on top of the pandemic, Australia is enduring a spate of rocky relations with China, its biggest trading partner.
	Frydenberg said the situation with China is ""very serious"" but his government is focusing on striking deals with other countries in Asia and beyond.
	""We have great produce, and we have great services, and we have great resource sectors, and I'm very optimistic about the opportunities for our exporters around the world,"" he said.
	Australia's relationship with China worsened this week after a Chinese official tweeted a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.
	Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the image ""repugnant"" and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. But China has not backed down.
	The post took aim at alleged abuses by elite Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.
	Tensions have been growing this year since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the pandemic. China has imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

	The small German biotech firm BioNTech, started by a husband and wife team with Turkish roots, had never brought a vaccine to market before. 
	But its experimental technology has now become the first authorized for use in the Western world to help end the coronavirus pandemic.
	Along with its U.S. partner Pfizer, BioNTech on Wednesday said its COVID-19 vaccine has been granted approval by Britain, with a rollout planned for as early as next week.
	Mainz-based BioNTech was co-founded in 2008 by Ugur Sahin and his wife Ozlem Tureci, both scientists and the children of Turkish immigrants to Germany, as well as Austrian cancer expert Christoph Huber.
	In normal times, BioNTech and its roughly 1,500 employees are focused on developing specialised immunotherapies for cancer patients based on ""messenger RNA"" (mRNA) molecules that trigger the building of proteins in cells, to stimulate the immune system.
	It's this same technology, which has the benefit that it can be developed more quickly than traditional vaccines, that lies at the heart of its COVID-19 shot.
	The vaccine will introduce synthetic mRNA into the human body to trick the immune system into producing the viral proteins needed to provoke a safe but robust offensive against the coronavirus.
	Sahin, 54, jumped into action in January shortly after reading about the emergence of a new and deadly coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. 
	By the time much of the planet was in lockdown in March, BioNTech had developed 20 vaccine candidates based on mRNA technology, he told Der Spiegel weekly.
	Those were eventually whittled down to a handful of the most promising options, with vaccine BNT162b2 now the frontrunner.
	Having struck a deal with U.S. pharma giant Pfizer to work together to develop mRNA-based flu vaccines in 2018, teaming up on a potential coronavirus vaccine was an obvious next move for BioNTech.
	The two companies announced in March that they aimed to jointly develop a COVID-19 jab, ""pairing Pfizer's development, regulatory and commercial capabilities with BioNTech's mRNA vaccine technology and expertise"", they said at the time.
	While global headlines tend to lead with Pfizer's involvement, Sahin insisted to Spiegel: ""It is our technology.""
	The co-operation is a good fit because it allows BioNTech ""to develop and distribute a possible vaccine in the shortest time possible"", he added.
	The BNT162b2 vaccine will require two jabs to be effective.
	BioNTech and Pfizer have said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion in 2021.
	In a clear sign that they were gearing up for mass production, BioNTech in September bought a manufacturing site in Marburg in western Germany from Swiss pharma group Novartis, along with its 300 employees, allowing it to produce millions of additional doses each year.
	BioNTech already has two other production sites in Germany, while at least four Pfizer sites in the United States and Europe will join in the unprecedented effort to roll out a vaccine at record speed.
	Sahin had told AFP in an interview in November that if all the players involved -- governments, pharma companies and vaccine logistics firms -- ""do a really good job"", then ""we can succeed in vaccinating 60 to 70 percent of the population by the autumn of 2021.""
	""And when we've accomplished that then we could have a normal winter. Without another shutdown.""
	Besides Britain, the European Union and a slew of countries including the US and Japan have already placed orders for millions of doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine as nations eagerly await the regulatory nods.
	BioNTech has also struck a deal with Shanghai-based Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which will have the exclusive rights to bring the vaccine to China."

	A Chinese woman who filed a sexual misconduct lawsuit against a TV host told cheering supporters at a courthouse Wednesday that she hopes her case will encourage victims of gender violence in a system that gives them few options to pursue complaints.
	Zhou Xiaoxuan spoke ahead of a trial in her lawsuit, which was delayed for two years and reflects the challenges Chinese women face in pursuing sexual misconduct complaints despite the spread of the global #MeToo movement.
	Zhou, 27, has accused Zhu Jun, a popular state TV host, of forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan (US$7,600) in damages.
	Zhu has denied the accusation and filed a defamation case against Zhou.
	""Even if ultimately in this case we don't get a legal win, as long as we can show to a lot of people (that) there are people like me, those of us who are victims of gender violence, that's already a type of win,"" Zhou said outside the Haidian District People's court in Beijing.
	A verdict was not expected on Wednesday.
	The movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual misconduct.
	The #MeToo global movement helped encourage activism in China, but came at a time when President Xi Jinping's government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.
	Women who complain face censorship and official resistance. The movement has seen few victories, and it was only in 2019 that sexual misconduct was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.
	In a rare victory, a woman who used the alias Liu Li won a case against her former boss in July. The boss, a social worker in the western city of Chengdu, was required to issue a public apology but no damages were awarded.
	""Together, we want to demand answers from history,"" read a sign held by a few dozen supporters outside the courthouse in Beijing on Wednesday. Others carried .Metoo signs.
	Many yelled ""jiayou,"" or ""add oil,"" a common Chinese phrase as reassurance to Zhou, who cried after speaking.
	Videographers working for foreign news agencies were taken away by police soon after Zhou gave her statement. It was unclear why they were held.

","
              '76 Days,' a new documentary shot in four Wuhan hospitals, captures a local horror before it became a global nightmare.
        ","

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/in-76-days-a-documentary-portrait-of-lockdown-in-wuhan-1.5212758,"NEW YORK -- 
	""Papa!"" screams a hospital worker, covered from head to toe in a Hazmat suit and PPE, in the opening moments of the documentary ""76 Days.""
	This is in the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan, back in January and February when the city of 11 million went into a 2 1/2-month lockdown and hospitals were overrun. The health worker's father has just died, and her agony at not being able to sit by his side is overwhelming. Her colleagues restrain her as she sobs, moaning, ""Papa, you'll stay forever in my heart.""
	""76 Days,"" shot in four Wuhan hospitals, captures a local horror before it became a global nightmare. Given the constraints at the time on footage and information from Wuhan, it's a rare window into the infancy of the pandemic. The film is directed by the New York-based filmmaker Hao Wu, who worked with two Chinese journalists -- one named Weixi Chen, the other is remaining anonymous -- to create of a portrait of the virus epicenter.
	Some of the images document the fear and confusion of those early days: A group of patients mill outside the hospital doors, pleading to be let in. Others are by now more familiar: Solitary deaths followed by phone calls to family members.
	""There has been so much news coverage and commentary about the pandemic but most of that has primarily been about statistics and our political divide,"" Wu said in an interview. ""What I think is missing is the human stories, the human faces of the pandemic.""
	That may be especially true for stories of the pandemic from China, which President Donald Trump and his supporters have been highly critical of, blaming it for the ""Wuhan virus."" Wu's film, though, consciously avoids politics to concentrate on the humanity inside the hospitals -- even if the workers are so obscured by their Hazmat suits that they're only identifiable by the names penned in sharpie on their backs.
	""I feel like right now there is such a toxic background to a lot of the discussions around the virus,"" Wu says. ""The virus is an enemy that doesn't care about your nationality.""
	""76 Days,"" which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, is being released Friday by MTV Documentary Films is more than 50 virtual cinemas. Last month, it was nominated for best documentary by the IFP Gotham Awards.
	It's among the first in a coming surge of coronavirus documentaries. A handful have already arrived, some -- snapshots in an ongoing drama -- hurriedly edited even as the scope of the pandemic has continued to expand. In October, Alex Gibney released ""Totally Under Control,"" a two-part indictment of the federal U.S. response to the virus. In August, the artist-activist Ai Weiwei debuted ""Coronation,"" a documentary he directed remotely with dozens of volunteers to capture the lockdown experience for ordinary Chinese people.
	For some, the films are too harsh a reminder of an all-consuming reality. But ""76 Days"" feels like a vital early draft of history. Wu's first instinct had been to create a more straightforwardly journalistic film examining what happened in Wuhan. But Wu -- a Chinese native who lives in New York with his partner and two children (he depicted his journey as a gay man in a traditional Chinese family in the 2019 Netflix documentary ""All in My Family"" ) -- soon recognized the difficulty of access and the rapidly changing situation would make such a film either very difficult or potentially stale by the time it was finished.
	""The images coming out of Wuhan were so harrowing. Everyone was scouring social media, trying to find out what happened in Wuhan, how it got so bad. A lot of us were so angry,"" he says. ""I started getting away from wanting to assign blame.""
	The journalists, working with press passes, would have typically been closely watched by Communist party minders but in the chaos were given more free rein. Wu leaned into a more observational approach without talking heads, and urged his collaborators to focus on the people and the details. One poignant shot shows the ziplocked cellphone of a deceased person quietly ringing.
	Wu's last trip to China was in January and February. Right after he came back, his grandfather was diagnosed with late stage liver cancer. He would die a month later. Wu, unable to visit because of travel restrictions and busy on the film, wasn't able to say goodbye in person.
	""For me, I was compelled to tell the story. It's almost like a tribute to my grandfather,"" says Wu. ""The shots that attracted me were those that showed the details of people willing to be nice to each other. I guess it was guilty about not being able to say goodbye to my grandfather, to hold his hand."""

              Government plans foreign buyers tax in bid to create affordable housing
          
","
              The Liberal government says it will take steps over the next year to tax foreign homeowners who live outside of Canada as part of a plan to lower housing prices.
        ","

                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/government-plans-foreign-buyers-tax-in-bid-to-create-affordable-housing-1.5212436,"TORONTO -- 
	The Liberal government says it will take steps over the next year to tax foreign homeowners who live outside of Canada as part of a plan to lower housing prices.
	It's an idea that has been growing in popularity over the last few years in provinces such as British Columbia, Ontario and Prince Edward Island, but some experts question how effective such a plan would be.
	In this week's fiscal update, the government says the plan will benefit first-time homebuyers and put more homes on the market by taxing homeowners who use Canada to passively store wealth in housing.
	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last year his government would introduce such a tax, praising a similar measure in British Columbia during his most recent election campaign.
	The B.C. government said last year its speculation and vacancy tax raised $115 million, paid mostly by owners based abroad, with Finance Minister Carole James crediting the tax as a factor behind the 5.6 per cent fall in home prices in the first part of 2019.
	Tsur Somerville, an associate professor at the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, said that while prices did fall in the Vancouver area after the introduction of foreign buyers' taxes, the policy is not a silver bullet for affordability.
	""If you're looking to address affordability, that on its own is never going to get you to affordability. But it can certainly be part of the package of both demand- and supply-side policies,"" he said.
	In addition to the speculation and vacancy tax -- on those who own local residences but do not pay provincial income taxes -- B.C. has also tried a property transfer tax on home purchases made by foreign nationals in Vancouver, according to the Chartered Professional Accountants regulator of British Columbia.
	In 2017, Ontario passed a speculation and vacancy tax on homebuyers in the Greater Golden Horseshoe who were neither citizens nor permanent residents. And in Prince Edward Island, non-residents must apply to a special commission to buy more than five acres of land.
	Renewed talk of taxing non-Canadian homebuyers comes as several housing markets across the country set sales records during the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing up prices amid low interest rates and a rush on telecommuter-friendly houses with yards.
	While the housing market has been hot, the government is looking for ways to finance $25 billion in new spending to support those hit hard by the pandemic.
	In practice, some markets with lots of demand from foreign buyers could see house prices decline but remain ""crazy unaffordable,"" even with the proposed tax, said Somerville. Other locales, such as tourist spots, could actually benefit from travellers owning vacation homes there, Somerville said, while still other cities may already have landlords who are struggling to find tenants as it is.
	For example, the supply of housing may be flexible enough in cities like Calgary or Edmonton where foreign-based buyers don't have that much impact on overall home prices, he said. Also, when it comes to building a giant apartment building, foreign investment from a European pension fund is unlikely to be an affordability problem, he noted.
	""I can't understand why you would introduce it at a national level,"" Sommerville said. ""That doesn't make any sense to me as a policy because it is not as if we are in a national crisis of foreigners buying up housing in every market and creating challenges on affordability. That's a stretch.""
	Somerville also noted that the policy has raised objections for targeting Chinese people in Vancouver, although different populations would be affected in different areas of the country.
	Andrey Pavlov, professor of finance at the Beedie School of Business at Simon Fraser University, said it was a ""terrible"" idea to nationalize British Columbia's policies, saying the tax would discourage foreign investments without improving affordability.
	Pavlov said that the share of first-time homebuyers has actually gone down since the tax was put in place in B.C. Other than Toronto and Vancouver, most Canadian cities can be built out to accommodate and even benefit from second homes for people like business travellers, said Pavlov.
	The problem with further taxing homeownership, Pavlov said, is that it could actually reduce the supply of housing by discouraging builders and investors. Pavlov also questioned whether the policy would help the government pay for its fiscal stimulus plans.
	""Our chance to repay the debts we are incurring now is to grow our economy as fast as we can,"" Pavlov said.

	The federal Conservatives are calling for a parliamentary committee to probe the Liberal government's plan to refit a National Research Council facility in Montreal to start producing a COVID-19 vaccine.

	Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole has criticized the Liberals for putting too much faith in Beijing, and blamed the failed deal for Canada being late to order vaccines from other foreign companies.
	The proposed committee probe would look at the investment intended to upgrade the NRC facility and how the deal impacted Canada's efforts to ensure the country has timely access to vaccines.

	While many scientists are racing to find vaccines to tame the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, other researchers are probing the past, trying to unravel one of the greatest mysteries of the virus: exactly where it came from.
	The World Health Organization has assembled an international team of 10 scientists to trace the origins of the virus.
	They will have to investigate both the suspect animals and how the first patients may have been infected.
	""We want to know the origin and we will do everything to know the origin,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Monday.
	But success is by no means assured.
	The first cases were reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan a year ago, before countries across the world began to record growing infections.
	The WHO said the first cases in Wuhan are believed to date from the beginning of December.
	But ""where an epidemic is first detected does not necessarily reflect where it started"", it added in a November report.
	In recent months, researchers in various countries have suggested that cases may have gone unnoticed long before December 2019, based on analysis of wastewater or blood samples.
	But there is a lack of ""clear evidence"" to back up these claims, said Etienne Simon-Loriere, of the virology department at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.
	To establish a virus family tree, researchers rely on genetic analysis.
	This can help ""better understand transmission dynamics, particularly how the virus may have evolved over time and how clusters might be related in time and place"", the WHO said.
	Scientists agree that the disease has an animal origin.
	""The big question is what led it to jump into humans,"" Etienne Simon-Loriere told AFP.
	Suspicions have fallen on bats, which are ""a major reservoir for coronaviruses"", he adds.
	But there would likely have been an intermediary animal to shepherd SARS-CoV-2 into people.
	The pangolin -- a mammal subject to rampant regional wildlife smuggling -- was identified as a likely carrier early on based on genetic analysis. But the case is not settled.
	WHO investigators will need to clarify this point by probing the wet market in Wuhan, which sold live and wild animals and has been linked to many of the early cases.
	The team will be armed with clues we did not have at the start of the pandemic.
	Simon-Loriere said they could look out for an animal with a virus receptor, a protein called ACE2, similar to the one found in humans.
	It is through this receptor that the virus latches onto cells.
	Some animals such as mink and ferrets have been found to have a very similar receptor to humans, while others are quite different.
	Another origin theory that swirled in conspiracy rumours for months was that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in the outbreak.
	Against the backdrop of diplomatic tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump touted the idea, claiming the virus could have leaked from the biosafety lab.
	China has rejected the accusations.
	While Simon-Loriere said it was not yet possible to completely rule out the idea that the virus escaped accidentally, he stressed that there was ""no indication it was manmade"".
	""All the elements of its genome have already been observed in nature, mainly in bat coronaviruses,"" he said.
	The WHO says understanding how an epidemic began is ""essential to preventing further introductions to the human population"".
	But it has warned that the process of tracing how a disease jumped from animals ""is a riddle that can take years to solve"".
	""The introduction of a new virus to the human population is one of the greatest mysteries an epidemiologist can hope to unravel,"" it said.
	The goal is to ""understand the mechanism and put in place measures to avoid the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-3, 4, etc."", said Simon-Loriere.
	For example, during the 2002 SARS epidemic, a ban on the consumption of civet cats -- identified as an intermediary host of that coronavirus -- is credited with having helped prevent the reintroduction of the virus into humans.
	The UN health agency sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the probe.
	But it has remained unclear when the larger team will be able to travel to China to start its work.
	In late November the WHO said it hoped to have a larger team of scientists on the ground ""as soon as possible"".
	The U.S. has accused Beijing of not being transparent, while it says the WHO kowtowed to China and dragged its feet in investigating how the outbreak first started.
	Others have voiced concern that the agency may have allowed China to dictate the terms of an international investigation into the origins of the virus.
	Tedros told critics to stop ""politicising"" the issue on Monday."

	New Zealand has joined Australia in denouncing a graphic tweet posted by a Chinese official that shows a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child's throat.
	Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that New Zealand has voiced its concerns directly with Chinese authorities.
	""This is an image that wasn't factual. It wasn't correct. And so in keeping with our principled position where images like that are used, we will raise those concerns and we'll do it directly,"" Ardern told reporters.
	China has not backed down from the tweet and said there will be no apology.
	Ardern's criticism was more muted than Australia's. She faced an awkward choice of how far to get involved in a conflict between New Zealand's closest ally, Australia, and its biggest trading partner, China.
	Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called the image ""repugnant"" and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. The post took aim at alleged abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.
	The incident is further souring already tense relations between Australia and China.
	The image, which appeared to show the soldier slitting the child's throat, was posted by Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry. He wrote a caption with his tweet: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.""
	He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia's military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the Afghanistan conflict. The report recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.
	Asked about the issue at a daily briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.
	""What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,"" Hua said.
	Morrison said Zhao's tweet was ""utterly outrageous"" and a terrible slur against Australia's military.
	It ""is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,"" he told reporters in Canberra. ""The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes.""
	Morrison said his government contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it on Tuesday but could still be viewed. Zhao's account comes with a Twitter label stating that it's a Chinese government account.
	Despite China blocking Twitter and other U.S. social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.
	Zhao was criticized by the U.S. in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that U.S. soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China's high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.
	Morrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.
	""But this is not how you deal with them,"" he said. ""Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.""
	The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports."

              Top secret: Biden gets access to President's Daily Brief
          
","
              Joe Biden has had his first look as president-elect at the President's Daily Brief, a top secret summary of U.S. intelligence and world events -- a document former first lady Michelle Obama has called ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.""

	Joe Biden has had his first look as president-elect at the President's Daily Brief, a top secret summary of U.S. intelligence and world events -- a document former first lady Michelle Obama has called ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.""
	Biden has already had eyes on different iterations of the so-called PDB, which is tailored to the way each president likes to absorb information.
	More than a decade ago, Biden read President George W. Bush's PDB during Biden's transition into the vice presidency. After that, he read President Barack Obama's PDB for eight years. Beginning Monday, after a four-year break, he's reading U.S. President Donald Trump's PDB.
	""The briefers almost certainly will be asking Biden what he prefers in terms of format and style,"" said David Priess, author of ""The President's Book of Secrets,"" a history of the PDB. ""At a minimum, they're seeing what seems to resonate most with him so that when they make the book his book, they can tailor it to him.""
	Obama's PDB was a 10- to 15-page document tucked in a leather binder, which he found waiting for him on the breakfast table. Later in his presidency, he liked reading the ultra-secret intelligence brief on a secured iPad.
	""Michelle called it ""The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book,"" Obama wrote in his recently released book, ""A Promised Land.""
	""On a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems,"" Obama wrote. ""Nearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable -- a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9-11.""
	From now until Inauguration Day, Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will be reading the PDB crafted for Trump, who had delayed giving Biden and Harris access to it as he contests the outcome of the election.
	Trump, who prefers absorbing information in visual ways, likes short texts and graphics.
	""Trump himself said during his campaign and during the transition in 2016 that he did not like reading long documents -- that he preferred bullet points,"" said Priess, who has not seen any of Trump's PDBs. ""It probably has charts, tables, graphs -- things like that. Not the parody that people make that it's like a cartoon book ... but something that is more visual. But we don't know for sure.""
	The written brief, which Trump doesn't always read, often is followed by a verbal briefing with an intelligence official, although those oral briefings stopped at least for a time in October. Priess said he didn't know why they stopped or if they had resumed, but that they stopped at a time when Trump was spending much of his time on the campaign trail.
	Before Trump authorized Biden to get the PDB as president-elect, Biden was given some intelligence background briefings as a candidate. But they were more general and did not include the nation's top secrets.
	The other thing that a president-elect gets is a briefing ""on CIA's covert actions,"" former acting CIA director Mike Morell said at an event hosted by the Center for Presidential Transition based in Washington. ""It's important for the president-elect to get this briefing ... because on Inauguration Day, these covert actions will become the new president's.""
	In 1961, President John F. Kennedy read his first brief while sitting on the diving board of a swimming pool at his retreat in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. President Lyndon Johnson liked to read his brief in the afternoon. President Richard Nixon relied on his national security adviser Henry Kissinger to peruse the briefs and tell him what he thought the president should know.
	As the laborious recount of ballots dragged on in 2000, President Bill Clinton decided that then-Gov. George W. Bush should get access to his PDB just in case he was the winner. Bush became was the first incoming president to read it before he was president-elect.
	Biden is getting the PDB later than usual because of Trump's ongoing protest of the election results. Trump approved the briefings for Biden last Tuesday, a day after his administration approved the formal transition process to his successor.
	When Biden walks into the Oval Office, he'll be inheriting nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, changing political dynamics in the Middle East, the winding down of America's presence in Afghanistan and rising competition from China.
	Biden had access to the PDB in Wilmington, Delaware. Harris received it in a secure room at the Commerce Department, where the presidential transition offices are located.
	Even Biden, who has decades of experience in foreign policy, could be the victim of an old political adage that no matter how informed he thinks he is, he could learn otherwise from the PDB.
	Former CIA Director Michael Hayden wrote in his book that revelations and new insight found in the PDB are known as ""aw s---"" moments. As in: ""Aw s---,"" he wrote, ""wish we hadn't said that during that campaign stop in Buffalo.""

              Opinion: Is America back? A steep hill to climb for the Biden administration

	Recently, when president-elect Joe Biden introduced the team that will handle foreign and security policy issues in his new administration, he used the slogan ""America is back”.
	Easier to say than achieve, I suspect.
	Firstly, Biden will have a lot of work to do domestically: a pandemic that continues to wreak havoc in the U.S., an economy to rebuild, and above all, trying to bring back unity after a Trump period that divided the United States in unimaginable ways.
	Still, the United States remains a great power, it will have no choice but to play its role on the international scene. The future secretary of state Antony Blinken is well acquainted with international affairs. The next ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat, and John Kerry, former secretary of state under Obama, appointed as special envoy on climate change are both experienced and competent.
	Biden has confirmed a return to multilateralism. Washington is expected to rejoin the Paris Accord on climate change and will reintegrate some international organizations such as the World Health Organization. It is to be expected that the American voice will be heard again at the United Nations in a more cooperative mode. This is good news.
	Biden will also need to repair the damage done by his predecessor by re-establishing normal relations with traditional allies in Europe, Canada and elsewhere.
	It is expected the U.S. will reclaim its usual place in leading NATO. Trump denigrated this organization and worked to weaken it for reasons that escaped observers.
	However, the world has greatly changed during Trump's four years.
	French President Macron, German Chancellor Merkel and European Union leaders are most probably relieved that common sense will return to the White House but, having been burned, they will want to give themselves some time to see how the Americans will behave on a number of trade and other issues.
	Biden said that the U.S. is ready to lead the world again. Not sure it is a universally shared objective. An increased involvement perhaps, but returning to a pre-Trump era may not be possible.
	Prime Minister Trudeau and his team have already begun bilateral contacts, promoting the importance of Canada in the American economy. Relations with our southern neighbour will not necessarily be more favourable to our interests, but at least there will be dialogue and not insults from the president. Nevertheless, there may be a few differences, notably because of Joe Biden's (Buy America) protectionist agenda and his opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline project.
	The big challenges for the next administration will of course be China and probably issues in the Middle East, particularly Iran. It is expected that the confrontational approach with Beijing will be abandoned in favour of an alliance with Europeans and others to make the Chinese understand that it is in their interest to better respect the rule of law and improve the human rights situation. Will this work? Beijing is becoming more and more self-confident. It took advantage of the American withdrawal from the world stage to advance its pawns. It has just signed a free-trade agreement with its Asian neighbours that corresponds to 30 per cent of world trade.
	Biden said the U.S. wants to join the multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran abandoned by Trump. This may not be easy to achieve because his government has adopted a long list of economic sanctions that the Iranians will want to see abandoned before making their own concessions. Negotiations are likely to be long and complicated, and Republican politicians in the Senate, if they remain the majority, will not help. The recent assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist may not be the last attempt by opponents of the agreement to create additional difficulties before the departure of Trump from the White House.
	Elsewhere in the region, relations between Biden and Netanyahu will not be as warm as with Trump, but the link between Israel and the United States should remain strong. Moreover, Biden said that the U.S. Embassy will stay in Jerusalem. The Palestinians hope that their situation will improve with Biden. To a certain extent, it may be the case. The Israelis will not always have the green light in the context of the settlements on the West Bank, for instance, and the U.S. financial assistance for the Palestinians will probably return. But will the US try to revive the peace process? This is doubtful. Israel has strengthened its ties with several Gulf countries recently and the momentum seems to be changing in the region. Not in the direction of a two-state solution.
	The United States will likely show more interest in defending human rights. Some countries like Saudi Arabia or Egypt will not appreciate it.
	Other issues will attract attention, such as migrants from Central America, a region that has suffered greatly from COVID-19, but also climate change. Migration should be managed in a more humane way than under Trump.
	It will also be interesting to see how relations with Trump's great friends the Turkish, Russian and North Korean despots will be. What about Cuba? Trump had scrapped Obama’s openness towards Havana.
	The Americans have lost ground because of Trump's chaotic and uncoordinated policy. It is not clear that the damage is temporary. Let's hope for Biden that ""America is back"" will be a more successful theme than Trudeau's ""Canada is back”.

              'I need a date': Ontario premier to ask drugmakers about COVID-19 vaccine delivery timeline

              Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he will be speaking with vaccine manufacturers to find out when COVID-19 vaccines will be going into Ontarians' arms.

	Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he wants to know exactly when COVID-19 vaccines will be going into Ontarians' arms.
	Speaking to reporters at an event in Vaughan, Ont. on Monday, the premier said he is no more comfortable about the timeline for immunizations in the province now than he was last week.
	""I have to get answers. I've been asking the federal government. We need to know when we're getting it, how much we're getting and what we're getting,"" Ford said. ""There's different vaccines out there so, to be perfectly frank, I'm not any more comfortable than I was last week.""
	Ford said he would be speaking to vaccine makers, and added that he had a call with Pfizer line up for Monday afternoon.
	""The clock is ticking,"" he said. ""We need answers, and we've worked very collaboratively with the federal government, but, you know, we need the answers. There's three simple answers that we need. We can't find out at the last minute that we're getting vaccines tomorrow.""
	Canada has paid to secure access to as many as 414 million doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines, as of late November, with an estimated six million doses expected to arrive in the country by March 31, 2021. The federal government has said that it has a $1-billion fund available to use for purchasing vaccines and the first Health Canada approvals could come before Christmas.
	Prime Minister Trudeau created a firestorm last week when he said Canadians would have to wait to be vaccinated for COVID-19 because the first doses off the production lines will be used in the countries where they are made.
	On Sunday, federal Conservative leader Erin O'Toole accused the Trudeau Liberals of waiting until a deal with a Chinese company had fallen through before making deals with Pfizer and Moderna, creating delays for Canadians.
	However, over the weekend, the head of U.S.-based Moderna told the CBC that Canada is ""not at the back of the line"" when it comes to receiving doses of its vaccine candidate. 
	Ford said he's going to be asking the Pfizer CEO when Ontario will be getting its share of vaccines.
	""I'm sure their answer is, well, it's going to go through the federal government. I need a date. I've been asking and asking,"" Ford said. 
	Ford then compared the securing of vaccines to any other major business transaction.
	""When you place an order for hundreds of millions of dollars and you aren't getting answers, either—and I'm not accusing anyone of this—but either something's going on, someone's not being honest, or there's incompetence, or maybe both. I'm not sure. And that's not accusing anyone, the federal government or the pharmaceutical companies, but the clock is ticking,"" the premier said.
	""Everyone's spending hundreds of millions of dollars and you can't give me a delivery date? Unacceptable.""
	In a tweet on Monday, Ford said he also spoke with staff from British drugmaker AstraZeneca. 
			Delivering the COVID-19 vaccines will be one of the biggest logistical challenges our province has ever faced.

	A subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma, according to a person familiar with a Justice Department tax investigation of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden's son.
	The breadth of the subpoena, issued Tuesday, underscores the wide-angle lens prosecutors are taking as they examine the younger Biden's finances and international business ventures.
	Hunter Biden's ties to Burisma in particular have long dogged the policy work and political aspirations of his father, Joe Biden, now the president-elect of the United States. It's unclear whether Hunter Biden's work at the Ukrainian company is a central part of the federal investigation or whether prosecutors are simply seeking information about all his sources of income in recent years.
	The person was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	A lawyer for the younger Biden, George Mesires, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment for this story and a spokesman for the Biden transition team declined to comment.
	Hunter Biden confirmed Wednesday that his taxes are under federal investigation. The revelation comes at a delicate time for the president-elect, who is building out his Cabinet and will soon decide on his nominee to run the Justice Department, the same department overseeing the investigation into his son.
	In addition to the Burisma-related request, the subpoena issued last week also seeks information on Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other financial transactions.
	The probe was launched in 2018, the year before his father announced his candidacy for president. At one point in the investigation, federal prosecutors were also examining potential money laundering offences, two people familiar with the matter told the AP.
	Hunter Biden said he only learned of the investigation on Tuesday.
	The younger Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then vice-president, was helping conduct the Obama administration's foreign policy with Ukraine. President Donald Trump and his allies have long argued, without evidence, that Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine influenced the Obama administration's policies toward the Eastern European nation.
	Senate Republicans said in a report earlier this year that the appointment may have posed a conflict of interest but did not provide evidence that any policies were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	The president-elect is not believed to be a focus of the investigation. He has not weighed in on the merits of the investigation, saying only to reporters on Friday that he was ""proud of my son.""
	For months, the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh has also been collecting information from Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and others as part of the Justice Department's process to receive and analyze information related to Ukraine, including documents Giuliani wanted to present to prosecutors that he had been gathering in Ukraine about Joe and Hunter Biden.
	In announcing that process in February, Barr cautioned that the department had to be careful about any information coming from Ukraine, saying: ""There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, a lot of cross currents. And we can't take anything we received from Ukraine at face value.""
	The former New York City mayor was a main character when the House voted to impeach Trump. The impeachment inquiry centred on Trump's dealings with Ukraine's president and whether he abused his office by seeking the investigation into the Bidens. Giuliani pressured officials to do the investigations and has been pushing unsubstantiated corruption allegations against the Bidens.
	Giuliani himself had also been under federal investigation, with federal prosecutors in Manhattan examining whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the matter. It was unclear whether that investigation remains active as Trump has discussed the possibility of preemptive pardons for some of his family members and close associates, including Giuliani."

	Jimmy Lai, the 73-year-old Hong Kong media tycoon and advocate for democracy, was denied bail Saturday after being charged the previous day under the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's new national security law.
	Lai faces a charge of collusion with foreign elements to endanger national security, apparently for tweets he made and interviews or commentaries he did with foreign media.
	The Apple Daily, a feisty pro-democracy tabloid owned by Lai, said he is accused of asking a foreign country, organization or individual to impose sanctions or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.
	His case was adjourned to April 16 at the request of prosecutors, who said police needed time to review more than 1,000 tweets and comments made on his Twitter account, the Apple Daily reported.
	The newspaper said his charge sheet listed several foreign politicians who followed Lai on Twitter and cited commentaries he wrote and interviews he did with foreign media.
	Lai, who was already being held on other fraud charges after police raided his media company, could be seen handcuffed to a chain around his waist as guards led him to a van to go from prison to court. He wore a navy blazer and an open-neck shirt.
	Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year after stormy protests in 2019 that started over an extradition bill and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.
	The new law outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. It has constricted free speech in the city, and democracy activists see it as a way to suppress dissent.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday morning Asia time that the security law ""makes a mockery of justice."" He called for Lai's release, saying his only crime is speaking the truth about China's authoritarian Communist Party government.
	Lai, the highest-profile person charged under the security law, has also been arrested for other alleged offences this year. He has been charged with taking part in unauthorized protests and with fraud over alleged violations of office lease terms.
	He has advocated for other countries to take a harsher stance on China, and met with Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence in the U.S. last year to discuss the extradition bill, which the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew.
	Pence also tweeted about Lai, saying the charges against him are ""an affront to freedom loving people around everywhere."""

	Relatives of a dozen Hong Kong residents who have been detained in mainland China for more than 3 1/2 months made a plea Saturday to be informed of the timing of any trials and whether they can attend.
	The request underscored the sharp contrast between the relatively open legal system in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and that of the mainland, where often little information is divulged until a trial is over.
	""I miss my son so much,"" the mother of Wong Wai-yin, one of the detainees, said, choking up. ""I want to visit him so badly. I haven't seen my son in a very long time -- it's almost four months. Please tell me (about the trial). I'm just an ordinary mother.""
	The 12 were arrested at sea in August while they were apparently making a bid to flee to Taiwan after a tough national security law took effect in Hong Kong earlier this year.
	They were picked up after entering mainland waters for crossing the maritime border without permission. At least some took part in anti-government protests in 2019 and were facing charges in Hong Kong.
	Though Hong Kong is a part of China, travellers must still pass through immigration when going to and from the mainland.
	Two are being held on suspicion of organizing an illegal border crossing. The group has been locked up in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong.
	The relatives covered their faces with masks, and some wore sunglasses, caps or hoods to hide their identities as they spoke at a news conference. They did not give their names.
	Owen Chow, an activist who has been helping the families, said they wanted to know whether the trials would be open to the public and if family members could attend.
	He and some family members questioned the authenticity of letters some of the latter had received, purportedly from their detained relatives, saying they were being held in a good environment and not abused.
	""The only thing I can do is to have dissatisfaction and be angry,"" said a relative of Tang Kai-yin, another detainee. ""I don't know what else to do."""

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pledged Saturday to rejoin the Paris climate accord on the first day of his presidency, as world leaders staged a virtual gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the international pact aimed at curbing global warming.
	Heads of state and government from over 70 countries took part in the event -- hosted by Britain, France, Italy, Chile and the United Nations -- to announce greater efforts in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel global warming.
	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of the Paris accord, wasn't represented at the online gathering. But in a written statement sent shortly before it began, Biden made clear the U.S. was waiting on the sidelines to join again and noted that Washington was key to negotiating the 2015 agreement, which has since been ratified by almost all countries around the world. 
	""The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency,"" he said. ""I'll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office.""
	Biden reiterated his campaign pledge that his administration will set a target of cutting U.S. emissions to net zero ""no later than 2050.""
	Experts say commitments put forward by the international community in the past five years have already improved the long-term outlook on climate change, making the worst-case scenarios less likely by the end of the century. But wildfires in the Amazon, Australia and America, floods in Bangladesh and East Africa, and record temperatures in the Arctic have highlighted the impact an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times is already having on the planet.
	""If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees (Celsius) this century,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, urging world leaders to declare a ""climate emergency.""
	The Paris agreement aims to cap global warming at well under 2 C (3.6 F), ideally no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F), by the end of the century. Meeting the temperature target will require a phasing-out of fossil fuels and better protection for the world's carbon-soaking forests, wetlands and oceans.
	The UN chief called the announced U.S. return to the Paris accord ""a very important signal.""
	""We look forward for a very active U.S. leadership in climate action from now on,"" Guterres said. ""The United States is the largest economy in the world, it's absolutely essential for our goals to be reached.""
	Biden insisted that the dramatic economic shifts needed would be positive for American workers.
	""We have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy,"" he said.
	American representatives at the virtual meeting included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and U.S. business leaders, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook.
	Also absent from the event were major economies such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most have offered no significant improvements on their existing emissions targets lately.
	Environmental campaigners singled out Brazil's recent announcement that it will stick to its target of cutting emissions by 43 per cent over the next decade compared with 2005 levels and aim for net zero by 2060 -- later than most other countries.
	By contrast, an agreement Friday by European Union members to beef up the continent's 2030 targets from 40 per cent to at least 55 per cent compared with 1990 levels was broadly welcomed, though activists said it could have aimed even higher.
	China, the world's biggest emitter, also surprised the world in September by announcing a net zero target of 2060, with emissions peaking by 2030. In his speech Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping provided further details on his country's medium-term goal for improving energy efficiency and ramping up electricity generated from renewable sources of power such as wind and solar.
	But Xi also cautioned that ""unilateralism will lead us nowhere"" -- a veiled reference to discussions in the EU to impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that have less stringent emissions standards than the 27-nation bloc. The issue is likely to dominate discussion between China, the EU and the U.S. in coming years.
	The Maldives, an Indian Ocean nation made up of low-lying islands that are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, announced Saturday that it will now aim to achieve net zero by 2030, one of the most ambitious goals worldwide. Bhutan and Suriname claim to have already achieved that goal.
	The 189 countries that are party to the Paris agreement are required to submit their updated targets to the United Nations by the end of the year. This would normally have occurred at the annual UN climate summit, but the event was postponed for a year because of the pandemic.
	The gathering, now scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, will see haggling over financial support for poor countries to cope with climate change, and fine-tuning the rules for international markets in emissions trading. Britain, next year's host, announced this month that it's aiming to cut emissions by 68 per cent over the next decade and end state support for fossil fuel industry exports.
	Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who was a key player at the Paris negotiations, said leaders had a duty to be optimistic about their ability to curb global warming.
	""Because if we don't, the alternative is unthinkable,"" she said. ""None of us adults alive today want to have on our shoulders the responsibility of turning over a world that is a world of misery for generations to come.""

	Canada is no longer training with the Chinese military, the Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons on Thursday, after Conservative defence critic James Bezan questioned why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would maintain such relations with China.
	The issue came to a head following a report by the Globe and Mail that top officials at Global Affairs, concerned the Chinese government would view it as a retaliatory move over its detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, was “alarmed” that General Jonathan Vance cancelled winter military exercises with the People’s Liberation Army in 2019 at CFB Petawawa.
	The news comes as Kovrig and Spavor marked their second anniversary in Chinese prison on what Canada and its Western allies say are unfounded espionage charges that followed Canada’s arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant in December 2018.
	“Our government always stands up for Canadians at home and abroad and this includes our relationship with China. But let me be very clear, we do not train with Chinese military,” said Minister Sajjan, adding that this initiative was originally put in place by the Conservative government under Stephen Harper.
	“It was the previous government that actually signed a co-operation plan initiative in 2013 under Rob Nicholson, when he was the Minister of National Defence … because of the agreement they had signed, this is one of the reasons why we actually changed our approach because of the concerns the member outlined,” Sajjan said.
	Bezan, who served as Parliamentary Secretary of National Defence under Nicholson at the time, said Canada was engaging in “hostage diplomacy” and that the Chinese government back then “is completely different to the Chinese government today.”
	Conservative leader Erin O’Toole called the joint training exercise a “dangerous path for the Trudeau government to take"" and called Canada's dealings with China a ""dangerously naive approach [that] has put Canada and our citizens at risk.”
	The Canadian Armed Forces have participated in various joint and regional military exercises for decades with some two dozen Pacific Rim countries. Specifically, Canada advanced its bilateral defence relationship with China through talks between senior military officials on both sides in March 2012 and June 2013. The Cooperation Plan Initiative, which would guide defence-related activities, was signed in Ottawa in August 2013.
	China’s President Xi Jinping, who came into power in March 2013, has tightened his control over the country in recent years through mass detention and surveillance of its Muslim population in Xinjiang, a crackdown on activism, heavy Internet censorship, consolidation of power and removal of presidential term limits. He has also taken a more assertive and harder-line approach to foreign affairs and defending China’s interests.
	Meng’s arrest, and the subsequent arrest of Kovrig and Spavor shortly after, soured relations between Canada and China. Trudeau has spoken to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the situation, but has not said whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department’s efforts to extradite Meng. Should the U.S. withdraw its charges against Meng, it could give China a reason to release Kovrig and Spavor.
	“We will always stand up for Canadians who are arbitrarily detained. This is one of the reasons why we actually stopped our training with the Chinese,” Sajjan said.

              Diverse TV holiday season includes all-Asian Lifetime movie
          
","
              In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”

                  Friday, Dec. 11, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/diverse-tv-holiday-season-includes-all-asian-lifetime-movie-1.5227204,"
	In one scene from the Lifetime TV movie, “A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” a co-worker says to Suzy, an Asian American architect in Los Angeles: “I didn't know if Christmas was a big deal where you're from.”
	Retorts Suzy: “I'm from Maine.”
	A lot of viewers of a cozy Christmas film might just shrug off the insinuation that Suzy is somehow not American. But for an Asian audience, that brief exchange is a knowing reminder that microaggressions don't take a holiday. They especially haven't in the wake of the pandemic, which has triggered anti-Asian racism and terms like “Chinese virus” and “kung flu.”
	“I think it's great timing for us for this movie to be coming out now during the pandemic with the perception of the Asian culture and the `flu' and all,” Canadian actor Jacky Lai, who plays Suzy, told The Associated Press. “I really do hope that this (movie) - with our faces - is able to hopefully be welcomed by people into their homes and see us as just your American/Canadian friends.”
	“A Sugar & Spice Holiday,” premiering Sunday, may be the first feel-good TV Christmas flick to feature a mostly Asian ensemble. It's one of several projects where cable channels are demonstrating a desire for inclusion this yuletide season. The shift comes a year after the Hallmark Channel dropped an ad that included a same-sex couple. The fallout pointed to an overall diversity problem in the genre with not just the LGBTQ community, but communities of colour. Recent months of racial unrest only added to the conversation within the entertainment industry about representation.
	Tia Maggini, vice-president of Lifetime Original Movies, says it was a coincidence that screenwriter Eirene Donohue, who is Asian American and had worked with the them before, came to them with the story pitch.
	“It was exciting to be presented with this particular point of view that has been long overdue for the Christmas movie genre,” Maggini said in a statement. Most important: The movie itself was actually funny and “full of Christmas heart.”
	Indeed, the rom-com has all the warm, familiar holiday movie tropes. Suzy returns to the small town where she grew up for Christmas, is persuaded to revive her baking skills for a local gingerbread house competition and is assisted by her former high school crush (Tony Giroux).
	Her father is played by veteran actor Tzi Ma. Despite a year filled with high profile film roles in “The Farewell” and “Mulan,” Ma didn't hesitate to join a Lifetime movie.
	“It was the first time a Chinese American family was featured on a Christmas story,” Ma said in an email. “Lifetime has a tremendous Asian American following. It's a way to say thank you to them.”
	In Hollywood, it can often feel like studios only cast Asians in narratives where there's some kind of hardship or East-meets-West struggle. And with TV holiday movies, they're almost nonexistent. Meanwhile, there are white actors who have made a baker's dozen of them. Like any other group, Giroux says, Asians deserve to see themselves in lighthearted fare regularly.
	“I think it's so important to have all sorts of stories with any culture - for them to have exposure to the stories of struggle but it's such a delight to see something lighter, to see aspects of culture that aren't surrounded with times of difficulty,” Giroux says.
	Giroux, who is Canadian, is also looking forward to queuing up a movie where his grandparents can see themselves.
	“I'm really excited for them to see a story that covers part of their story. My grandparents immigrated here from China from in the `50s,” Giroux says. “That's why being part of this project is telling a story that I'm really a part of.”
	Lai grew up loving romantic comedies. She remembers unexpectedly getting emotional watching “Crazy Rich Asians,” the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.
	“You hear people say there hasn't been a movie like this in 25 years. You hear those things. But it's not until I sat in the theatre and watched someone who looked like me on screen who wasn't a ninja or a nerd but someone just like me. I remember the way it felt,” Lai says. ”I am so excited that there's another movie like that and hopefully we bring joy and open some minds with this movie and more opportunities.“
	The movie is lovingly sprinkled with Chinese American nuances on script and screen. These include a photo of Suzy's deceased grandma flanked by incense sticks and the entire family eating with chopsticks. And it is definitely the only Christmas movie to feature both gingerbread and stinky tofu, a beloved Chinese dish known for its pungent smell.
	“I love that we were able to kind of include a lot of nice details. ... It's really a romantic comedy where the characters happen to be Asian American,” says Jennifer Liao, the director. “It's nice to make an Asian American movie that's not necessarily completely frontloaded with having to carry the weight of cultural identity issues and things like that.”
	“Sugar & Spice” is not the only holiday movie expanding the definition of who can lead these kinds of flicks. A handful of networks, including Lifetime and Hallmark, have a Christmas-themed movie on their slate featuring a same-sex pairing. Tony winner Ali Stroker, who uses a wheelchair, stars in Lifetime's “Christmas Ever After.”
	Does Liao feel pressure as “the first” even on such an innocuous project to bring in a sizeable audience? “I feel like the pressure is more to deliver something that I and everybody else worked on can be proud of. That was really no. 1,” Liao says.
	Lai doesn't see the point of getting caught up in things like ratings.
	“I think that it is really, really nice to hear when someone says `I got to see someone who looks like me on screen.' That will never get old,” Lai says. “We get more responses like that - for me, the movie did its purpose.”

	India on Friday rejected a Chinese allegation that it is responsible for high tensions along their disputed border.
	Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said the six-month standoff between the two countries' armies ""has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side, which has sought to effect a unilateral change in the status along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh.""
	Srivastava was responding to a statement by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying in Beijing on Thursday that ""the rights and wrongs of what has happened in the China-India border area are very clear and the responsibility lies squarely with the Indian side.""
	Hua also said that China is firmly committed to safeguarding its sovereignty. ""We hope that India will work with China in the same direction and do more things conducive to solidarity, co-operation and common development,"" she said.
	The standoff between the Asian giants erupted into a fierce brawl in May and worsened into hand-to-hand combat on June 15 with soldiers using clubs, stones and fists, leaving 20 Indian troops dead. China is believed to also have suffered casualties, but has not given any details.
	The countries have held a series of talks on ending the standoff without any breakthrough."

Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistant

              U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.

	U.S. financial news service Bloomberg said Friday that Chinese authorities have detained one of its Beijing-based news assistants on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security.
	Bloomberg reported that Chinese citizen Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building accompanied by security officers in plain clothes at about noon on Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.
	It quoted a Chinese government statement as saying Fan was detained by the Beijing branch of the National Security Bureau ""according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security.""
	China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.
	Bloomberg said it has been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and from China's embassy in Washington, D.C.
	It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held on suspicion of endangering national security, a vaguely defined charge that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.
	""We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,"" a Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.
	Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.
	China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.
	China this year expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other American outlets amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.
	Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials."

	China's sales of SUVs, minivans and sedans rose by double digits in November as the country recovered from the coronavirus pandemic, but were below pre-virus levels for the year, an industry group reported Friday.
	Sales in the industry's biggest global market rose 11.6% over a year earlier to 2.3 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 12.6% to 2.8 million, holding steady at October's growth rate.
	From January to November, passenger vehicle sales were off 7.6% from the same period of 2019, at 17.8 million. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 20.6% to 4.7 million.
	Full-year auto sales are on track to decline for a third year after hitting a peak in 2017.
	China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first country to reopen its economy after the disease was declared under control in March.
	November sales of all-electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles more than doubled, rising 104.9% over a year earlier. Sales in the first 11 months of 2020 edged back above pre-virus levels, rising 3.9% over a year earlier.
	Auto demand already was weak before China closed factories and dealerships in February to fight the coronavirus. Consumers are uneasy about slowing economic growth and a tariff war with Washington.
	That hurts global automakers that are looking to China to propel sales growth and are spending heavily to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet Chinese government sales quotas."

Chinese man extradited from Malaysia to U.S. over turtle-smuggling ring worth millions

A Chinese citizen who allegedly financed a turtle-trafficking ring has been extradited from Malaysia to the United States, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in a statement on Thursday.
	Kang Juntao, 24, from Hangzhou in eastern China, was initially charged with money laundering last February. Between June 2017 and December 2018, he allegedly financed a nationwide ring of people who purchased turtles in the U.S. belonging to five protected species, and arranged for them to be illegally shipped to Hong Kong.
	""The turtles were inhumanely bound with duct tape and placed in socks so as not to alert customs authorities,"" the DOJ statement said.
	According to Kang's indictment, at least 1,500 turtles -- with a total value of US$2,250,000 -- were smuggled out of the U.S.
	Using a PayPal account, Kang allegedly purchased turtles from sellers advertising on social media or reptile trade websites.
	These sellers allegedly shipped the turtles to ""middlemen"" who were ""typically Chinese citizens who entered the country on student visas,"" according to the DOJ. Kang allegedly paid and instructed them to repackage the turtles, and use false labels for shipment to Hong Kong.
	Once in Hong Kong, the turtles were allegedly sold on the black market for thousands of dollars each.
	Kang allegedly did not declare the turtles to U.S. or Chinese customs, or obtain required permits from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
	Authorities allege Kang trafficked the eastern box turtle, the Florida box turtle, the Gulf Coast box turtle, the spotted turtle, and the wood turtle -- all protected species under the CITES treaty.
	Kang was arrested at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport last January before his extradition to the U.S. on Thursday.

	Bahrain has announced plans to give the public free coronavirus vaccines, as Saudi Arabia said it approved an inoculation by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech to fight the pandemic.
	The island nation of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, made the vaccine pledge in an announcement published late Thursday by its state-run Bahrain News Agency.
	""A safe vaccine will be provided free of charge to all citizens and residents within the kingdom,"" the statement said, without elaborating on which vaccine it would offer.
	Bahrain plans to inoculate everyone 18 years and older in the kingdom at 27 different medical facilities, hoping to be able to vaccinate 10,000 people a day. Bahrain, an island in the Persian Gulf home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, has a population of around 1.5 million people.
	A week ago, Bahrain said it had become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine after the United Kingdom.
	The Pfizer shots, a so-called ""mRNA vaccine,"" contain a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. To be vaccinated, a person receives two shots over 21 days.
	In the time since, Bahrain has not responded to questions from The Associated Press, including on Friday. Pfizer told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the ""timing of delivery and the volume of doses,"" were confidential and declined to comment.
	Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculated some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine is an ""inactivated"" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it.
	The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday described the Sinopharm vaccine as 86 per cent effective, but provided few details and answered no questions. It marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of that shot.
	Earlier Thursday, Saudi Arabia's Food and Drug Authority said it had registered the Pfizer vaccine ""so that health authorities in the kingdom can then import and use the vaccine.""
	The kingdom said it based its decision on information given by Pfizer on Nov. 24, without elaborating. Pfizer on Nov. 18 said its vaccine is 95 per cent effective.
	A major challenge for the Pfizer shot in the Mideast remains the weather, however. The vaccines must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
	Saudi Arabia said its Health Ministry later would announce plans on how it would distribute the vaccine in the kingdom, the biggest Gulf Arab state, with a population of 34 million people.
	Egypt received its first shipment of the Sinopharm vaccine on Thursday via the United Arab Emirates."

	U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's historically challenging transition to power is suddenly becoming even more complicated.

For sure, it will complicate Senate confirmation hearings for Biden's yet-to-be-named attorney general, who could ultimately have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son.
	It all raises the prospect of even deeper dysfunction in a capital that is already struggling to address the nation's most pressing crises, including a surging pandemic whose daily death tolls are beginning to surpass the devastation of the Sept. 11 attacks. Republicans, particularly those eyeing presidential runs in 2024, are making clear they will press Biden on the issue.
	""Joe Biden needs to pledge today that he will co-operate with the federal investigation and answer any questions under oath,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Thursday, ""and that if he is sworn in as president, no federal investigator or attorney working on the Hunter Biden criminal case will be removed.""
	Hunter Biden has long been a source of worry for his father's campaign and was the subject of repeated unsupported accusations by President Donald Trump and his allies. But news of the probe, which was revealed on Wednesday and scrutinizes some of Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings and other transactions, caught most of his father's staffers by surprise.
	The president-elect had no public appearance Thursday as he moved forward with filling out his administration. But the investigation threatens to destabilize a transition that has prioritized a methodical rollout of Cabinet selections, White House hires and policy goals -- all meant to guarantee momentum when Biden takes office and immediately has to grapple with a surging pandemic and shaky economy.
	Most notably, the probe casts a spotlight on one of Biden's most important choices: his attorney general.
	Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland have emerged as the leading contenders, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press this week. But dynamics could shift, as any Biden choice now will be scrutinized for any perceived loyalty to the president-elect and bias in any probe of his son.
	Both Garland and especially Jones have longtime ties to Biden.
	The president-elect himself is not a subject of the investigation. And Biden aides believe that because other Hunter Biden stories have blown over, this will, too. They note that a tax fraud investigation pales in comparison to Trump's refusal to concede the election or to the pandemic that has killed more than 290,000 Americans.
	Biden is expected to announce more Cabinet picks, but not attorney general, on Friday.
	Trump's initial public response was surprisingly muted, just a pair of tweets about a Fox News segment on the story Wednesday night. But privately, he demanded to know why the investigation was not revealed ahead of Election Day, accusing officials of deliberately stalling in order to help Biden's chances, according to two Republicans familiar with the conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.
	Other Republicans, including possible presidential contenders, were anything but shy in piling on.
	""If there were ever circumstances that created a conflict of interest and called for a special counsel, I think those circumstances are present here,"" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said Thursday. ""The Biden family has been trading on Joe Biden's public office for 50 years. Do we really think that that will change if Joe Biden becomes president, the highest office in the land?""
	Some of Trump's children have also faced some legal questions.
	Donald Trump Jr. was scrutinized in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe for the 2016 meeting he had with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. And Ivanka Trump was recently deposed by investigators from the District of Columbia attorney general's office as part of its lawsuit alleging the misuse of inaugural funds.
	The Hunter Biden investigation is the latest in a series of politically charged inquiries that the Justice Department has grappled with in the past five years, following probes into Hillary Clinton's email use and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
	Regardless of the facts of the investigation, a new Justice Department will likely feel compelled to assert its independence from the White House following allegations that its actions were overly politicized during the Trump administration. Biden has said he will play no role in department investigative decisions.
	""There are plenty of people that are going to have their hands in this one, but I think it's really going to be driven by the new administration's push to have total independence on any investigation,"" said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Weinstein, a New Jersey defence lawyer.
	""I think that's going to be paramount,"" he added. ""They are going to bend over backwards to make sure that they do the contrary to the current administration -- which is independence, let the investigation takes its course.""
	In this case, though, there is no perfect outcome for Biden.
	A protracted criminal investigation that results in an indictment would be a major distraction and then some as the new president tries to implement his agenda. But if the Justice Department decides against bringing charges, officials will feel pressure to explain their steps and reassure the American public the inquiry was done in a competent and thorough way.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including to Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe.
	The federal investigation, centring on potential tax crimes, had been going on at least a year before Biden announced his candidacy. Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to voting because of a department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts.
	Biden, fiercely protective of his own family, was said to be, in a statement released by his transition, ""deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	Biden struck a similarly defiant tone throughout the campaign whenever questions emerged about his son, which they frequently did. When Trump assailed Hunter Biden as a drug user during the first presidential debate in Cleveland, his father acknowledged that Hunter had had past substance abuse issues but added, ""He's worked on it. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of my son.""
	The spotlight on Hunter Biden intensified in the election's final weeks, after Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed unsubstantiated claims about his foreign business dealings. Those were based in part on New York Post reporting on a laptop that supposedly once belonged to Hunter Biden and was abandoned at a Delaware repair shop.
	Hunter Biden had joined the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then the vice-president, was helping conduct Obama administration foreign policy with Ukraine. But, in a subsequent report, Senate Republicans did not produce any evidence that the hiring influenced U.S. policies.
	Joe Biden largely refused to even acknowledge the laptop controversy. His son, meanwhile, kept almost completely out of the public eye during the nearly 18 months his father was running for president.
	One of the few times he was seen was on stage outside the convention centre in Wilmington, Delaware, as his father was surrounded by joyous family members following his speech declaring victory in the presidential election. Hunter Biden, and his baby son, were right in the middle.

              'None of us imagined this': Michael Kovrig's wife marks two-year anniversary of his detention 
          
","
              On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrig’s imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.

                  Thursday, Dec. 10, 2020
                ",https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/none-of-us-imagined-this-michael-kovrig-s-wife-marks-two-year-anniversary-of-his-detention-1.5226164,"OTTAWA  -- 
	On the grim two-year anniversary of Michael Kovrig’s imprisonment in China, his wife says she worries most about the state of his mental health heading into yet another holiday season alone.
	""Here we are, two years later, still speaking about him being in detention. None of us would have imagined this was going to be the case,"" said Vina Nadjibulla in an interview on CTV’s Power Play on Thursday.
	""I hoped sincerely that Michael would be home by now and instead he’s facing a prospect of his third Christmas alone, in isolation, in detention.""
	Kovrig, a former diplomat, and fellow Canadian Michael Spavor were arrested in China on Dec. 10, 2018, and charged with allegations of state spying for Canada. The Canadian government calls their detention arbitrary, while most in the diplomatic community view it as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days prior in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request.
	Consular access has been limited throughout the pandemic; the two men went 10 months without communication with Canadian representatives.
	""Our contact has been very limited between January and October. There were no consular visits, there were very few letters from Michael. Finally, in October we were able to get a consular visit and at least confirmation and a reassurance that he is still healthy and is doing well,"" said Nadjibulla, who is married to Kovrig but separated.
	Canada’s Ambassador to China Dominic Barton who is leading the effort to secure Kovrig and Spavor’s release, told a House of Commons committee this week that the two men looked ""robust"" and that one ""would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Nadjibulla called that long-awaited visit this fall a ""huge relief"" but notes she remains deeply concerned about his mental health.
	""Michael is doing everything he possibly can to keep his mind occupied with positive thoughts, with virtuous thoughts, with prayers of gratitude, with philosophical passages. Reading really provides him solace day-to-day, he essentially says that is what gets him through moment-to-moment, is being able to read and have access to books, which we’ve been advocating for quite a bit,"" said Nadjibulla.
	The Liberal government remains adamant it’s doing all it can to free the men, despite opposition criticism that Ottawa has been ""kowtowing"" to China over the last several years.
	""Today is the sad anniversary of the illegal abduction and imprisonment of two innocent Canadians in China,"" said Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole during a press conference on Thursday.
	""For months China has unfairly targeted our farming exports. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out mass internment of the Uighurs in concentration camps and still the Liberals keep pushing for more involvement and more engagement with China.""
	Optimism sparked last week when the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Justice Department was in talks with Meng’s legal team to resolve her fraud charges and allow her to return home should she admit to criminal wrongdoing. It led to speculation that the arrangement could pave a way for Kovrig and Spavor’s freedom.
	Nadjibulla says, more broadly, she was left hopeful after hearing that during the first call between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden the leaders discussed the fate of the two men.
	""I pray that we will be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.

	In his darkest moments, Michael Kovrig draws strength from knowing that his fellow Canadians and people around the world are working to free him and Michael Spavor from their respective Chinese prison cells.
	As much as that matters, Kovrig's wife Vina Nadjibulla says he is also subjecting himself to a strict regimen to strengthen his mind and body because he views that as the key to his survival.
	She says that not only is Kovrig determined to survive his ordeal, he wants to reclaim his freedom better and stronger than when he lost it.
	Kovrig and Spavor are marking two years in separate Chinese prisons, on what Canada and dozens of its Western allies say are trumped-up espionage charges in retaliation for the RCMP's December 2018 arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.
	Canada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, one of the few outsiders to see them, said this week Kovrig and Spavor are anything but broken men, and that seeing how they've endured their captivity was inspiring.
	""Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, and their families, have shown truly remarkable perseverance in the face of an unimaginable situation,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.
	Kovrig is ""marshalling every ounce of his willpower and strength"" to cope with his difficult situation, Nadjibulla said in an interview this week.
	""He says that knowing that Canadians care, knowing that the world cares, and people are fighting for his release, makes him feel stronger, and keeps hope alive,"" she said, drawing on letters that he has written in captivity.
	""He hopes that he will be able to come out from this experience not only having survived it, but with a commitment, with resolve to rebuild his life better, to contribute even more to society.""
	A statement from Global Affairs on Thursday to The Canadian Press said that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing spoke directly with Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to clarify a media report earlier in the morning that suggested the two Michaels had gone on trial in China.
	The statement said that ""contrary to what has been reported in the media this morning, there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.""
	The statement also said that ""the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson.""
	The Canadian Press also reached out, through intermediaries, to request interviews with Spavor's friends and family but was unsuccessful. Spavor worked as an entrepreneur in the Chinese city of Dandong, where he is imprisoned near the North Korean border.
	Kovrig was most recently an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Washington and before that he was a member of Canada's diplomatic corps, a career-focused on preventing deadly conflicts.
	""He hopes that he can continue to do that, and he can rejoin the broader conversation in the world with life and not just continue to be isolated and cut off in the way that he is,"" said Nadjibulla.
	She said Kovrig is devouring books from the meditations of stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, to Tolstoy's ""War and Peace,"" to Nelson Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom."" He's reread one of his pre-prison favourites, ""Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, because it contains a key message for him.
	""It essentially posits that it's important to cultivate an ability to not only survive traumas or disruptions but to become better and stronger as a result. So, this idea of building back better. I know it's very much on the minds of many of us as we recover from the pandemic,"" she said.
	Kovrig is also drawing on stoic philosophical teaching that, among other things, calls for the transformation of ""fear into prudence, pain into information,"" said Nadjibulla. Kovrig has added ""anger into determination and grievance into resolve"" to that philosophy.
	He has been drawn to St. Paul's Letter to the Romans, the sixth book of the New Testament, ""which says suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. And Michael is doing everything possible to keep hope alive,"" said Nadjibulla.
	Kovrig is subjecting himself to a strict physical regimen, forever on the move in his small cell striving to walk the equivalent of five kilometres daily because he knows his mind cannot thrive if his body is not strong, said Nadjibulla.
	Robert Malley, Kovrig's boss at the International Crisis Group, says his imprisoned colleague can hold the plank, a core body exercise of endurance, for 18 minutes. In solidarity, Crisis Group colleagues recently had a plank competition but the closest anyone got was seven minutes. They're also walking 7,000 steps a day, the equivalent of five kilometres.
	Malley said he and his colleagues are in awe of Kovrig's discipline.
	""None of us can be prepared for that, unless you're in the military and you're told this could happen. But he seems to have had all of the reflexes, instincts that are necessary,"" said Malley.
	When Kovrig is released one day his colleagues hope stories of their attempts to replicate some of his exercises will help him heal and, perhaps, bridge the gap growing between them and him, said Malley.
	Kovrig only found out the scope of the global pandemic during Barton's on-site virtual visit in October -- his first contact with Canadian diplomats since January because Chinese authorities wouldn't allow any contact due to COVID-19, said Nadjibulla.
	He was shocked at the pandemic's scale and compared it to a zombie apocalypse and the movie ""Contagion.""
	Kovrig is also aware that he is one of ""two Michaels"" and understands that both he and Spavor ""are caught in this bigger situation,"" she said. It's not a topic that can be discussed during the now-resumed 30-minute consular visits.
	Nadjibulla said she was happy to hear that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. president-elect Joe Biden about the two Michaels in their recent conversation. Trudeau refused to discuss the content of that conversation last week, or whether Biden might revisit the Justice Department's attempted extradition and prosecution of Meng.
	If the U.S. withdrew its charges, Meng could go free, and that might give China reason to free the two Michaels.
	""Our Michael and Michael Spavor are caught in a bigger geopolitical struggle,"" Nadjibulla said. ""They're pawns in a bigger political game involving the U.S., China and Canada. And they have been in the situation for two long years, for no other reason than being Canadian citizens.""

              China restricts U.S. official travel to Hong Kong

              China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.

	China is imposing restrictions on travel to Hong Kong by some U.S. officials and others in retaliation for similar measures imposed on Chinese individuals by Washington, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	U.S. diplomatic passport holders visiting Hong Kong and nearby Macao will temporarily no longer receive visa-free entry privileges, spokesperson Hua Chunying said.
	U.S. administration officials, congressional staffers, employees of non-governmental organizations and their immediate family members will face ""reciprocal sanctions,"" Hua said.
	She was apparently referring to U.S. sanctions that bar certain Chinese and Hong Kong officials from travelling to the U.S. or having dealings with the U.S. financial system over their roles in imposing a sweeping National Security Law passed this summer that ushered in a crackdown on free speech and opposition political activity in Hong Kong.
	Hua said the move was taken ""given that the U.S. side is using the Hong Kong issue to seriously interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's core interests.""
	Those sanctioned ""have performed egregiously and are primarily responsible on the Hong Kong issue,"" she said at a daily briefing.
	""China once again urges the U.S. side to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and not go further down the wrong and dangerous path,"" Hua said.
	China had long threatened to retaliate against the U.S. sanctions and other actions seen as hostile.
	Earlier, China's official Xinhua News Agency said Trump administration officials are ""digging a hole"" for the next U.S. administration's relationship with China through actions targeting the country and its officials.
	Steps such as restricting visas for the 92 million members of the ruling Communist Party and their families have ""again exposed the sinister intentions of extreme anti-China forces in Washington to hijack China-U.S. relations for their own political gain,"" Xinhua said in an editorial.
	The U.S. State Department last week cut the duration of such visas from 10 years to one month, another example of the increasingly hard-line stance adopted by the administration in its waning days. That came in addition to the sanctions targeting specific Chinese and Hong Kong officials over their actions in Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and elsewhere.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has signalled he intends to keep pressure on China, he's also expected to seek a return to more conventional, less confrontational style of diplomacy. Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington's stance toward Beijing.
	""By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-U.S. relations on issues concerning China's core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration's relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains,"" Xinhua said.
	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea.
	Dozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.
	On Wednesday, Pompeo accused U.S. universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was ""poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends.""
	Chinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying U.S. accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.
	Perhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.
	""Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation,"" Xinhua said. ""The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-U.S. relations."""

	The Justice Department's investigation scrutinizing Hunter Biden's taxes has been examining some of his Chinese business dealings, among other financial transactions, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	The investigation was launched in 2018, a year before his father, Joe Biden, announced his candidacy for president, but it isn't clear which entities might be tied up in the probe, and the inquiry was not disclosed to Hunter Biden until Tuesday.
	The younger Biden has a history of international affairs and business dealings in a number of countries, and the revelation of a federal investigation puts a renewed spotlight on the questions about his financial dealings that dogged his father's successful White House campaign.
	Federal investigators served a round of subpoenas on Tuesday, including one for Hunter Biden, according to another person familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe. The tax investigation centres on his business dealings, the person said.
	Investigators did not reach out in the weeks prior to the election because of a Justice Department policy surrounding elections that prohibits overt investigative acts, one of the people said.
	In a statement released by the president-elect's transition office, Hunter Biden said he learned about the investigation on Tuesday, but he did not disclose specifics about what was being scrutinized.
	""I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,"" he said in a statement.
	He has long been a target of President Donald Trump and his allies, who have accused him of profiting off his political connections. Trump and his supporters also raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption related to Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine at the time his father was vice-president and leading the Obama administration's dealings with the Eastern European nation.
	Late Wednesday, Trump tweeted a quote from New York Post columnist Miranda Devine claiming, ""10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.""
			“10% of voters would have changed their vote if they knew about Hunter Biden.” Miranda Devine @nypost @TuckerCarlson But I won anyway!
	The disclosure of the federal investigation, led by the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware, comes at an awkward moment for the incoming president, who is assembling his Cabinet. His pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation into the new president's son if it is still ongoing when Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.
	The transition team said in a statement, ""President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""
	It could also add weight to Trump's broad accusations that Biden was weak on China. Trump took a tough line on China during the campaign as he tried to deflect blame for the coronavirus. Biden has rejected the characterization that he was weak and said, that unlike Trump, he would rebuild global coalitions to check China's power.
	A New Yorker profile on Hunter Biden last year detailed some of his business work in China, including how he accompanied his father on a 2013 trip to Beijing, where he met with a business associate. He also acknowledged having received a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon involved in liquified natural gas projects. He downplayed the idea that the gift could have been intended to affect his father's policy. He told the magazine that he gave the diamond to an associate.
	""What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn't in office,"" he said.
	Hunter Biden has been caught up in controversies before. While his father was vice-president, Hunter joined the Naval Reserve and was discharged after testing positive for cocaine in his system, later revealing a yearslong struggle with addiction.
	He also joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014, sparking concerns about the perceptions of a conflict of interest given the elder Biden was deeply involved in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. An investigation by the Republican-led Senate did not identify any policies that were directly affected by Hunter Biden's work.
	In the weeks before the election, Trump supporters used the existence of a laptop they said was connected to Hunter Biden -- and the emergence of someone who maintains he had business discussions with him -- to raise questions about Joe Biden's knowledge of his son's activities in Ukraine and China. The president-elect has said he did not discuss his son's international business dealings with him and has denied having ever taken money from a foreign country.
	The laptop surfaced publicly in October when The New York Post reported on emails that it said had come from Hunter Biden's laptop and that it said it received from Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer.
	A third person familiar with the matter said the tax investigation does not have anything to do with the laptop. Like the other people who spoke to the AP, the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
	In a CNN interview last week, President-elect Biden addressed the business dealings of his son Hunter and his brothers, pledging that they would avoid any perceived conflicts of interest during his time in office.
	""My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict, where there's appropriate distance from the presidency and government,"" Biden said.

	I love charcuterie boards because anything goes! And this year, with COVID-19 keeping everyone home and no large family gatherings being permitted, pull out all the stops and make your loved ones feel extra special. Pull out the fine china, your best crystal, and polish the silverware. Get some fancy napkins and go crazy with ingredients. Here are some suggestions but honestly…the sky is the limit. Stop into your local deli – they are offering lots of great options to keep your family intrigued on their taste journey around the board.
	Scatter the ingredients all over the board like an abstract painting, or be more geometric. It all works. Just have fun!
	Serve with neat teaspoons, cheese knives and whatever else you need. If you don’t have small pots for all the relishes, spreads and mustard, find a tea cup or espresso cup, or ramekin."

              Why did Mount Everest's height change?
          
","
              China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.

	The world's highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story.
	China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.
	As definitive as that sounds, geological changes, the complicated business of measuring a mountain and varying criteria for determining the world's highest peak will likely ensure the question isn't settled for good.
	The mountain's height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down.
	The countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest's height earlier this year.
	""Nature tends to strike a balance,"" he told the official Xinhua News Agency. As an example, Dang cited a massive 1934 earthquake that wiped out 150 years of steady height increase in a few moments.
	There's more than one way to measure a mountain.
	Last year, a Nepalese team set up a satellite navigation marker on Everest's peak to gauge its exact position via GPS satellites. A Chinese team undertook a similar mission this spring, though it used the Chinese-made Beidou constellation of navigation satellites, along with other equipment.
	At the same time, Nepalese crews took measurements with modern, laser-equipped versions of instruments called theodolites, first used to gauge the mountain's height in 1856 by measuring angles using trigonometry.
	The Nepalese team also used ground penetrating radar to measure the amount of snow and ice that sits on top of its highest rock.
	China and Nepal jointly presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 metres (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The two had diverged for years over the mountain's actual height.
	The new height is 0.86 metres (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries' two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The agreement announced Tuesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between them.
	Measuring the height above sea level has always been tricky because ocean levels vary considerably depending on tides, magnetism and other factors. Rising sea levels are creating another factor for future measurements.
	How high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain's height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills.
	As measured from the Earth's core, Ecuador's Mount Chimborazo is the world's highest, standing more than 2,072 metres (6,800 feet) above Everest. Because the Earth bulges in the middle, mountains along the equator are farther from the core.
	Measuring from the foot of the mountain to the peak, Hawaii's Mauna Kea is the tallest. Most of it, however, is under the sea.
	This story has been corrected to say that the agreement was announced Tuesday, not Wednesday.

	Companies including the Chinese arm of TripAdvisor Inc. have been ordered by regulators to overhaul their mobile phone apps in what the Chinese government said is a crackdown on pornography and other improper content.
	The National Cyberspace Administration ordered the removal of 105 apps including TripAdvisor from app stores this week, although it gave no details of what each app was accused of doing wrong. It cited what it said were public complaints about obscene, pornographic and violent information or fraud, gambling and prostitution.
	The ruling Communist Party tightly controls what the Chinese public sees online and has launched repeated crackdowns on websites and apps.
	TripAdvisor China, a joint venture between TripAdvisor and its Chinese partner Trip.com, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
	Following the removal of its app in China, Nasdaq-listed TripAdvisor's stock price was down 1.68% to $29.59 at the market's close in the U.S. on Tuesday.
	TripAdvisor owns a 40% stake in TripAdvisor China, with Trip.com owning the other 60%. Under the partnership, the companies share its travel inventories and content.

              UAE says Chinese vaccine 86 per cent effective, offers few details
          
","
              The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.

	The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86 per cent effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.
	The announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.
	The UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.
	The UAE's Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they ""have reviewed Sinopharm CNBG's interim analysis of the Phase III trials.""
	""The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,"" the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.
	It wasn't immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving ""official registration"" without elaborating on what that meant.
	Emirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	However, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a ""COVID-19 vaccine."" The centre was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine's efficacy.
	The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80 per cent of its adults in an operation starting this month that's relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.
	Sinopharm's shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus' spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot.
	Top officials in the UAE, including Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.
	Already, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95 per cent effective, while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5 per cent effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70 per cent effective, but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.
	In transport, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must remain at cold temperatures -- negative 70 degrees Celsius (negative 94 degree Fahrenheit) and negative 20 degrees Celsius (negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively.
	The Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people in China had received its vaccine.
	Meanwhile Wednesday, Abu Dhabi announced it would resume ""all economic, tourism, cultural and entertainment activities in the emirate within two weeks."" It attributed the decision to ""successes"" in halting the spread of the coronavirus.
	Abu Dhabi has required those travelling into the emirate from the UAE's other six sheikhdoms to take a coronavirus test within 48 hours prior to arrival.
	Since the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over 9 million people.
	In Iran, meanwhile, President Hassan Rouhani angrily blamed U.S. sanctions for making it difficult for Tehran to purchase medicine and health supplies amid the pandemic.
	And in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the first shipment of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, calling it a ""big day of celebration"" for the country.
	""I believe in this vaccine. I expect it will receive the appropriate approval in the coming days,"" Netanyahu said, adding that he intended to be the first to receive it. ""We see the end of the pandemic.""

	Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are physically and mentally well and showing inspiring resilience as they near the end of their second year of imprisonment by the People's Republic, says Canada's ambassador to China.
	Dominic Barton also says Chinese authorities were paranoid about containing the spread of COVID-19 as they denied consular access to the two men from January to October.
	""Our understanding of why it was the case is that the Chinese are completely paranoid about the virus,"" Barton said in testimony Tuesday night before the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations.
	Barton is leading Canada's efforts in China to win the release of Kovrig and Spavor, who were arrested and imprisoned on Dec. 10, 2018, in what is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Chinese high-tech executive Meng Wanzhou.
	After months of delay, Barton was most recently granted on-site virtual consular access to Kovrig and Spavor in November, following similar virtual visits with the two Canadians a month earlier.
	""We were obviously very frustrated at not being able to get access even virtually because as far as we know . . . the virus doesn't go through televisions,"" said Barton.
	The Chinese government has charged Kovrig and Spavor with espionage but the Canadian government says their detention is arbitrary and has called repeatedly for their release.
	Barton said it wasn't just Canada that was blocked by the Chinese from visiting prisoners charged in national security cases; the U.S. and Britain faced similar restrictions.
	When Barton was able to see them, he said he was able to verify they were in good physical and mental condition.
	""They are robust,"" said Barton, who was testifying from Beijing via video link. ""You would be very impressed by seeing both of them.""
	Spavor is being held in a prison in the city of Dandong near the North Korean border while Kovrig is in a Beijing area prison.
	""It's a strange thing. We fly to these places, or drive to them in the case of Beijing. And I know that the Michaels (are) literally sort of on the other side of the wall, but you've got, you know, two big TVs,"" he said. ""It's like this.""
	Barton's main purpose for testifying was to describe the three-day Chinese government-controlled visit to Tibet that he and nine other Western diplomats undertook in October. He said he remains concerned about the human rights situation there and that they only saw what the Chinese wanted them to see.
	Even though the area is filled with security cameras, as is the capital of Beijing, Barton said he wandered off a couple of times to visit with locals without his Chinese government minders in tow.
	He said Canada is not reluctant to raise human rights concerns with China even though some people think Canada is in the Chinese ""doghouse"" these days. He also said that even though he knew the visit to Tibet would be controlled, it sent a signal to local people that the outside world still cared about their plight.
	Thursday marked Barton's second appearance before the committee this year, following testimony in February in which he declared ""the chill is real"" in Canadian relations with China.
	In February, Barton described an angry, emotional meeting during his first diplomatic contact with his Chinese counterparts after being appointed to the post in 2019 after a long career in business, which included being the global managing director of the consulting giant McKinsey & Co.
	His position in the company gave Barton high level access in China and across Asia, something the Trudeau government is hoping to leverage to win freedom for Kovrig and Spavor while maintaining economic relations with its second largest trading partner.

              Another judge blocks Trump's TikTok ban; app still in limbo

              A federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.

	A federal judge has blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.
	The Trump administration had tried to ban the short-form video app from smartphone app stores in the U.S. and cut it off from vital technical services. TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.
	Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said in a ruling Monday that the Commerce Department ""likely overstepped"" its use of presidential emergency powers ""and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to consider obvious alternatives.""
	Nichols is the second federal judge to fully block the Trump administration's economic sanctions against the app as the court cases proceed.
	The Trump administration has alleged that TikTok is a security threat because the Chinese government could spy on app users' personal data. TikTok has denied it's a security threat but said it's still trying to work with the administration to resolve its concerns.
	Trump in September gave his tentative blessing to a proposal by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns by having the U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart invest in TikTok. Oracle would manage U.S. user data under the arrangement. But a federal agency still has to review and finalize an arrangement.
	A government deadline for ByteDance to complete the deal passed on Friday, and it's not clear what the status of the agreement is.
	The Treasury Department, which chairs the agency reviewing the deal, said Friday that the agency ""is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks arising from the transaction.""
	The Trump administration's aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.
	While President-elect Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, it's not clear what his administration will carry on the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to secure a ban, or increase the involvement of U.S. companies."

              The day soccer dyed: Chinese match off because 'hair not black enough'

	A women's university soccer match in China descended into farce and was eventually called off after players were told that they were not allowed to have dyed hair, state media said Tuesday.
	The incident trended on the Twitter-like Weibo, angering many people, and comes after the men's national team were ordered to cover up their tattoos.
	The latest high-profile example of the shrinking space for individualism in communist-ruled China came when the women's sides of Fuzhou and Jimei universities met in a college league match in the southeastern province of Fujian.
	The teams were reportedly warned about the ban on dyed hair beforehand but as they were getting ready for the match on November 30 officials spotted that players from both sides had failed to heed the reminder.
	At least one Fuzhou University player was then spotted frantically having her hair dyed again in an attempt to return it to its original colour, but it failed to dry in time, the Beijing News said.
	The newspaper, citing someone at the scene who gave the pseudonym Zhang Zhi, said that some Fuzhou players also ran off to a nearby hair salon to buy black hair dye.
	However, one Fuzhou player was deemed ineligible because her hair was ""still not black enough"" so they were unable to field enough players, consequently forfeiting the match 3-0, the report said.
	Fuzhou University declined to comment when contacted by AFP. However, the China News cited the university as saying that the ban on dyed hair was ""in accordance with relevant regulations"" passed down from the education ministry in Beijing.
	""The relevant documents stipulate that players cannot dye their hair, have weird hairstyles or wear any accessories,"" the official said, adding it was a nationwide edict that had already been in place before the match.
	Many on Weibo were aghast at the ruling and the brouhaha trended on the social media network, racking up more than 400 million views.
	""I thought I was reading North Korean news,"" joked one user on Weibo.
	""Am I really living in the 21st Century?"" asked another.
	President Xi Jinping is a soccer fan and has grand plans to make China a leading country in the world's most popular sport.
	However, soccer has found itself in the crosshairs of the Communist Party's drive for a homogenized society.
	Players on the national team routinely cover their arms with long sleeves or bandages to hide their tattoos.
	Body ink is traditionally frowned upon in China but it is increasingly popular among young adults, even as authorities make plain their disdain for it."

	Shares in China's biggest online health care platform rose 50% in their Hong Kong stock market debut Tuesday, reflecting investor enthusiasm for the fledgling industry as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
	JD Health, an arm of JD.Com Inc., China's biggest online retailer, sells medications, hospital care packages and online consulting by doctors.
	Chinese internet companies increasingly offer health services in a society where hospitals are crowded and distribution of drugs and medical supplies outside major cities is uneven. Online consulting with Chinese-speaking physicians is popular with families from China who live in the West or other developing countries.
	Other competitors include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group's Alibaba Health; Baidu Health, run by search giant Baidu.com Inc.; and WeDoctor, run by Tencent Holding, operator of the popular WeChat messaging service.
	The coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for Chinese online platforms.
	Investors have ""high hopes for this kind of companies to develop in China,"" said Jackson Wong, asset management director for Amber Hill Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	The ruling Communist Party has encouraged growth of the industry by authorizing online pharmacies to deliver prescription drugs.
	During the pandemic, patients switched from going online only for urgent care to staying in touch with doctors about chronic conditions, according to industry analyst Kevin Chang of Bain & Co.
	""This new pattern of digital engagements is likely to continue and to increase the frequency of consultations,"" Chang said in a report.
	Consumer spending and business activity have rebounded to above pre-pandemic levels after China, where the pandemic began in December, declared the disease under control in March and eased most controls. Restrictions on travellers coming from abroad still are in place and visitors to public buildings are checked for fever.
	JD Health raised about $3.8 billion by selling 20% of the company to public shareholders.
	It was Hong Kong's second-biggest stock offering this year behind parent JD.Com, which has shares traded in New York and raised $4.5 billion in June when it joined the Hong Kong exchange.
	The ruling party is encouraging use of online health services to reduce the burden on hospitals.
	JD Health said it plans to expand its online pharmacy and develop ""smart healthcare solutions"" supported by artificial intelligence to work with physicians.
	The company says it had 72.5 million active users in June, up 30% over a year earlier.
	The industry might face tougher competition once the coronavirus is brought under control and patients have more offline options, said Wong.
	""If vaccines are very effective and people start going out again, the growth of these online service providers might not be as high,"" said Wong. ""That would be the biggest risk for this kind of company.""

              Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.

	Hundreds of shoppers pack a wet market on a December weekday morning in the Chinese city of Wuhan, jostling to buy fresh vegetables and live fish, frogs and turtles.
	Almost a year since the city reported the world's first cases of COVID-19 in one of its handful of vast wet markets, and even as several other countries remain firmly in the grip of the subsequent pandemic, life in Wuhan has largely returned to normal.
	""I'm not afraid, what is there to be afraid of?"" said Nie Guangzhen, a fish and vegetable vendor.
	Nie and other shop owners along a narrow street, part of the larger wet market, were busily gutting fish for streams of buyers - some not wearing masks - as city cleaners sprayed down the pavements.
	Few hints remain of Wuhan's early role in the coronavirus pandemic, which has since infected more than 67 million people globally, killing around 1.5 million people.
	China first alerted the World Health Organization to 27 cases of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan on Dec. 31. Authorities shut down a wet market in the city the next day, after discovering some patients were vendors or dealers.
	That marked the start of a dark period for the city of 11 million in central China. Infections spiraled quickly to 50,000 cases, including almost 4,000 deaths. Officials responded by swiftly imposing a tough 76-day lockdown, erecting kilometers of thick yellow barricades through the city's deserted streets to keep people at home and businesses closed.
	The measures paid off. Wuhan has not recorded a new locally transmitted case in several months and is now indistinguishable from other Chinese cities with crowded shopping streets, traffic jams and tightly packed restaurants.
	""I really missed these more fun and exciting times, like going out shopping and eating with my friends,"" said 27-year-old shopper Hu Hang on Monday at a packed Wuhan night market selling Christmas sweaters among other goods.
	In the busy street, hawkers sell flowers and balloons, street performers including dancers and a clown perform while music blares from shops lining the road.
	The city's recovery is a sharp contrast to other major economies heading into the Christmas and New year holiday season.
	In the United States, the health system is under severe pressure as cases mount and health officials warn the worst is yet to come. The country recorded 15,000 deaths over the past week, the deadliest seven days of the pandemic since April.
	Several European countries have rolled out tight restrictions on gatherings ahead of Christmas, fearing a return to peak levels of cases because of festive celebrations.
	China's relative success in controlling the virus has become a key talking point in Chinese state media.
	""I haven't been overseas, so I don't understand it well, but looking at the TV it seems like foreign countries don't put human life first,"" said Mr Li, a 54-year old Wuhan street food vendor, who reopened his shop in June. ""The ideology of foreign countries is not as good as that of China.""
	China has taken steps, including mass testing millions of residents following small-scale outbreaks, to prevent a second wave of infections seen in many other cities and countries.
	At the gates of residential compounds, staff in blue tents monitor residents' smartphone health codes. In a public park, slogans on red propaganda banners urge people to remain vigilant.
	Wearing face masks is not mandatory, but most people do so in public.
	And while shoppers have returned to Wuhan's streets, Li and others say business is yet to return fully to normal.
	""The whole situation is not great, it's still a lot worse compared to the last few years,"" Li said, referring to a slump in sales during the time after lockdown when people were too afraid to return to the streets.
	Still, for many residents, lockdown memories have been superseded by the city's swift reopening - alongside new precautions.
	""I don't worry, because I'm doing a good job of protection,"" said wet market vendor Nie, who said she will continue to disinfect and boil her clothes. ""Even if there is a second wave, I will just stick to it.”

	The height of Everest, which is on the border between China and Nepal, was agreed on after surveyors from Nepal scaled the peak in 2019 and a Chinese team did the same in 2020.
	There had been debate over the actual height of the peak and concern that it might have shrunk after a major earthquake in 2015. The quake killed 9,000 people, damaged about 1 million structures in Nepal and triggered an avalanche on Everest that killed 19 people at the base camp.
	There was no doubt that Everest would remain the highest peak because the second highest, Mount K2, is only 8,611 metres (28,244 feet) tall.
	Everest's height was first determined by a British team around 1856 as 8,842 metres (29,002) feet.
	But the most accepted height has been 8,848 metres (29,028 feet), which was determined by the Survey of India in 1954.
	In 1999, a National Geographic Society team using GPS technology came up with a height of 8,850 (29,035 feet). A Chinese team in 2005 said it was 8,844.43 metres (29,009 feet) because it did not include the snow cap.
	A Nepal government team of climbers and surveyors scaled Everest in May 2019 and installed GPS and satellite equipment to measure the peak and snow depth on the summit.
	Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Nepal later that year and the leaders of the two countries decided that they should agree on a height.
	A survey team from China then conducted measurements in the spring of 2020 while all other expeditions were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
	Nepal's climbing community welcomed the end of confusion over the mountain's height.
	""This is a milestone in mountaineering history which will finally end the debate over the height and now the world will have one number,"" said Santa Bir Lama, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.
	China's official Xinhua New Agency quoted Xi as saying the two sides are committed to jointly protecting the environment around Everest and co-operating in scientific research.
	For China, the announcement appeared to be as much about politics as geography. China has drawn Nepal ever closer into its orbit with investments in its economy and the building of highways, dams, airports and other infrastructure in the impoverished nation.
	That appears to serve China's interests in reducing the influence of rival India, with which it shares a disputed border, and Nepal's role as a destination for refugee Tibetans.
	The Xinhua report said nothing about the technical aspects but heavily emphasized the joint announcement's geopolitical weight.
	China and Nepal will establish an ""even closer community of a shared future to enrich the countries and their peoples,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying."

              China trade surplus hits record US$75 billion as November exports soar

	China's politically sensitive trade surplus soared to a record US$75.4 billion in November as exports surged 21.1% over a year earlier, propelled by American consumer demand.
	Exports to the United States rose 46% despite lingering tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington, customs data showed Monday.
	Total exports rose to $268 billion, accelerating from October's 11.4% growth. Imports gained 5% to $192.6 billion, up from the previous month's 4.7%.
	Chinese exporters have benefited from the economy's relatively early reopening after the Communist Party declared the coronavirus pandemic under control in March while foreign competitors still are hampered by anti-disease controls.
	“Exports were much stronger than expected in November,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.
	Forecasters say that surge is unlikely to last into 2021 once coronavirus vaccines are rolled out.
	“We expect export performance to be less impressive,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.
	China's global trade surplus for the first 11 months of 2020 is $460 billion, up 21.4% from this time last year, already one of the highest ever recorded.
	Exports to the United States rose to $51.9 billion while imports of American goods gained 33% to $14.6 billion. The trade surplus with the United States swelled 52% over a year earlier to $37.3 billion.
	Beijing promised to buy more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports as part of the “Phase 1” agreement signed in January and aimed at ending a costly tariff battle over Chinese technology ambitions. China fell behind on meeting those commitments earlier in the year but is catching up as demand rebounds.
	The two governments agreed to postpone further planned tariff hikes on each other's goods but most penalties already imposed on billions of dollars of imports stayed in place.
	Chinese imports are growing faster by volume than by value because demand has been chilled by the shutdown of travel and industry, driving prices lower.
	China is on track to become the only major economy to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan falls.
	China's economy shrank by 6.8% from a year earlier in the first three months of 2020 after factories, shops and offices were shut down to fight the virus. Growth rebounded to 3.2% in the second quarter and accelerated to 4.9% in the three months ending in September.
	Automakers and other large manufacturers are back to normal activity, helping to drive demand for imported iron ore, copper and other raw materials. Retail sales are back above pre-virus levels and rose 4.3% over a year earlier in October.
	Also in November, exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 8.6% over a year ago to $37.5 billion while imports of European goods gained 4.5% to $26.2 billion. China's trade surplus with Europe widened by 20% to $11.3 billion."

	Canada's main stock index moved to within two per cent of a record high Monday on gains in the materials and technology sectors.
	Gold and silver prices increased, partly on expectations that U.S. politicians will agree to additional fiscal stimulus, said Angelo Kourkafas, analyst on the investment strategy team at Edward Jones.
	In addition, there are renewed geopolitical concerns about ongoing Brexit negotiations ahead of Wednesday's deadline and the potential for new U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials over the crackdown on Hong Kong.
	The February gold contract was up US$26.00 at US$1,866.00 an ounce and the March copper contract was down 0.8 of a cent at almost US$3.52 a pound.
	Materials rose 2.1 per cent as shares of Oceanagold Corp. surged 31.9 per cent while Kinross Gold Corp. were up 7.5 per cent.
	The improved performance of Canada's technology sector and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite in the U.S. were attributable to worsening coronavirus trends and lockdowns on both sides of the border, Kourkafas said.
	""The focus and the market's attention ... is looking forward for the vaccine potential distribution. And that continues to be the main driver of sentiment,"" he said in an interview.
	Canadian and U.S health regulators are expected to soon grant emergency authorization for at least two vaccines presented by Pfizer and Moderna. A third vaccine has also been developed by AstraZeneca.
	Technology rose 1.3 per cent with shares of Shopify Inc. up 2.9 per cent.
	""We have seen this kind of tug-of-war between vaccine optimism and worsening coronavirus trends and clearly the focus now, especially in the U.S., is turning to the negotiations in Washington.""
	The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 61.38 points to 17,582.35. It hit an intraday high of 17,611.48 that is less than two per cent or 359 points below February's record high.
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 148.47 points at 30,069.79. The S&P 500 index was down 7.16 points at 3,691.96, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was up 55.72 points at 12,519.95.
	The Canadian dollar was unchanged from Friday at 78.12 cents US.
	The January crude contract was down 50 cents at US$45.76 per barrel and the January natural gas contract was down 16.9 cents at nearly US$2.41 per mmBTU.
	Lower prices pushed the energy sector down 0.9 per cent with Tourmaline Oil Corp. off 5.1 per cent. The price fall is attributable to concerns about demand as new restrictions in movement translates into lower demand for travel and a pullback after last week's strong oil price gains.
	""So we're seeing kind of that effect of the renewed restrictions show up in a little bit of a loss of momentum in the economic data. And we expect that to likely persist for the remainder of the year and likely the first quarter of next year,"" said Kourkafas.

	Chinese vaccine company Sinovac announced Monday that it is planning to complete a new facility to double its annual vaccine production capacity to 600 million doses by the end of the year, while also securing a US$500 million investment in a boost to its COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.
	The company is currently conducting the last stage of clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia and is among the frontrunners of China' s vaccine efforts. China has at least five COVID-19 vaccine candidates running late stage clinical trials across more than a dozen countries.
	Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd., a pharmaceutical conglomerate, bought a 15% stake in Sinovac for an investment of $500 million. The funds will allow the company to ""improve our vaccine sales capabilities, expand in Asia markets, develop and access new technologies, and most importantly, accelerate our efforts to help combat the global pandemic,"" Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong said in a statement.
	On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of its experimental vaccine arrived in Indonesia and are expected to be approved for use soon.
	Sinovac's candidate is a two-dose inactivated vaccine, an old-school technology in which a live virus is killed and then purified. It can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F), within the range of a normal refrigerator, unlike some other vaccines candidates that require far lower temperatures.
	Sinovac's experimental vaccine is currently approved for emergency use in China, although it has not yet obtained final market approval. Under emergency use, it has been distributed to groups the Chinese government deemed suitable, including front-line medical workers and border personnel.
	The latest public data from the company, published in the science journal Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who have recovered from COVID-19."

Chinese probe orbiting moon with Earth-bound samples
          
","
              A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.

	A Chinese probe was orbiting the moon on Monday in preparation for the returning of samples of the lunar surface to Earth for the first time in almost 45 years.
	The ascent module of the Chang'e 5 spacecraft transferred a container with 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of samples after docking with the robot spacecraft on Sunday and was then cut free.
	The orbiter and reentry vehicle will circle the moon for another week awaiting a narrow time window to make the roughly three-day, 383,000-kilometre (238,000-mile) journey back to Earth. It will first ""bounce"" off the Earth's atmosphere to slow its speed before the reentry vehicle separates and floats down on parachutes to land on the vast steppes of Inner Mongolia, where China's Shenzhou crewed spaceships have also made their landings.
	If the mission succeeds, it will make China the third country after the United States and former Soviet Union to bring moon rocks to Earth. They will be the first fresh samples of the lunar surface obtained by scientists since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 probe in 1976.
	The Chang'e 5 ascent stage blasted off from the moon's surface on Friday, leaving behind the lander module flying the Chinese flag, according to the China National Space Agency, which also released a photo taken by the orbiter showing it approaching for its rendezvous with the ascender, a sliver of the Earth seen in the background.
	That marked the first time China had succeeded in lifting off a spacecraft from a celestial body, while no country had previously achieved the tricky feat of executing a robotic docking in lunar orbit. Controllers on Earth had to deal with distance and time lag while precisely manoeuvring a clamp into position with almost no room for error.
	The 23-day mission has been front page news in state media for days, paired with reports that China has officially lifted all of its citizens out of the most grinding form of poverty. Along with being a propaganda coup for the ruling Communist Party, the dual stories illustrate the vast economic and technological advances China has made since it became just the third country in history to launch a person into space in 2003.
	Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying praised the ""courage to explore, overcome difficulties and pay hard efforts"" of those who made the mission possible.
	""The entirety of the Chinese people are proud of the efforts and wisdom of the Chinese lunar exploration researchers,"" Hua told reporters Monday at a daily briefing.
	By way of cautious incremental steps, China is now in the midst of a series of ambitious missions that include a probe en route to Mars and the development of a reusable space plane about which little information has been provided.
	The Chang'e lunar program, named after the ancient Chinese moon goddess, has also been operating the Chang'e 4 probe on the moon's less explored far side for the past two years, while the Chang'e 3 rover launched seven years ago continues to send back data.
	Future plans call for returning a human to the moon five decades after American astronauts, along with a possible permanent moon base, although no timeline has been offered. China is also building a permanent space station to begin operating as early as 2022.
	U.S. opposition has prevented China's secretive, military-backed program from participating in the International Space Station, although the CNSA has been expanding its ties with other programs, including the European Space Agency, which has helped guide Chang'e 5 on its mission.
	Chang'e 5 touched down Dec. 1 on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side close to a formation called the Mons Rumker, an area believed to have been the site of ancient volcanic activity.
	The rocks and other debris were obtained both by drilling into the moon's crust and by scooping directly off the surface. They are thought to possibly be billions of years younger than those brought back earlier and may offer insights into the moon's history as well as that of other bodies in our solar system.
	The lunar exploration program has set up dedicated labs to analyze the samples for age and composition. China is also expected to share some part of them with other countries, as was done with the hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of rocks, sand, dust and other samples obtained by the U.S. and the former Soviet Union."

              China prepares large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccines

              Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country's 1.4 billion people.

	Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country's 1.4 billion people.
	Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a UN meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.
	Even without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.
	China's fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.
	On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of the Chinese company Sinovac's vaccine arrived in Indonesia, the government said.
	""We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,"" President Joko Widodo said.
	Within China, so far only one developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine. Others have been approved for emergency use on people deemed at high risk of infection.
	""We must be prepared for large-scale production,"" Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
	Sun, who has as overseen much of the country's response, visited one of Sinopharm's Beijing subsidiary companies, Sinovac and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use.
	The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month.
	The companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers.
	They say unlike Pfizer's vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed.
	Health experts question why China is using experimental vaccines on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders.
	Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year.
	The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use.
	Authorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine.
	The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60).
	Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July.
	In October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority.
	In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine.
	In September, Sinovac's CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government.
	Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year.
	Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year.
	Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response.
	A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China.

              A potential return for Meng may not guarantee release of Kovrig, Spavor: experts 
          
","
              If a deal is made and Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is allowed to go home, will two detained Canadians be released? Experts weigh in on the possibilities.

	Almost two years after Meng Wanzhou’s arrest in Vancouver's airport, the Huawei executive could be heading home soon.
	According to reports from the Wall Street Journal, the United States Department of Justice is ready to make a deal with the telecom giant, offering Meng a deferred prosecution agreement and allow her to return to China in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing in her ongoing criminal case.
	This could be welcome news for Canada, as Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been detained in China since Meng’s arrest, in what has widely been seen as retaliation from the Chinese government. Canada has also been subject to trade sanctions on canola, soybean, beef, and pork exports, leading to a 16 per cent decline of exports to China in 2019.
	""If she is returned, it opens the door for releasing the two Canadians, and I think that Ottawa is probably busy speaking with Washington and Beijing to try and make sure the solution will be a triangular one,"" said former Canadian ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques.
	However, experts are divided on how soon the Michaels will come home, or if they’ll be released in exchange at all.
	""The idealist in me says perhaps, but the realist says no,"" former diplomat Colin Robertson told CTV News.
	Robertson said this potential deal is only the first step as negotiations with China are always a long process.
	""We look at negotiations through different ends of the telescope and that can lead to misunderstandings,"" he said. ""It can also lead to false optimism, which is I'm afraid we might be encouraging right now.""
	One issue complicating the return of the Michaels is the consistent denial from the Chinese that their detentions were related to Meng's arrest, said Robertson.
	In June, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference: ""The Meng Wanzhou incident is in essence difference from the cases of the Canadians.""
	According to Zhao, ""the United States aims to oppress Huawei and other Chinese high-tech companies, and Canada is its accomplice.""
	""This is really between the United States and Ms. Meng,"" said Charles Burton, associate professor at Brock University and MacDonald-Laurier Institute senior fellow.
	""Would the Chinese authorities release Kovrig and Spavor, or would they continue to hold them to continue to exert pressure over Canada with regard to other political matters?""
	Though China has said in the past Meng's release ""could open up space"" to resolve Kovrig and Spavor's detention, the reports of the potential deal so far do not include any guarantees for the Canadians' return.
	""That's why we have to try and get as much undertakings from the Americans if they do decide to proceed down this road…that the Michaels are part of it,"" said Robertson.
	While it was U.S. President Donald Trump who issued Meng's extradition request, the incoming Biden administration is expected to remain tough on China. Robertson said the Canadian government needs to continue to press the Americans to make sure Kovrig and Spavor aren't forgotten once the Meng affair is resolved.
	""We've been left holding the bag,"" said Robertson.
	""We've been used by the Americans and we've certainly been abused by the Chinese, and the two Michaels are the real victims in this whole tragedy."""

              Negotiating contracts for vaccines in development needed flexibility: Anand

	Procurement Minister Anita Anand says that as soon as she knows when the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Canada, she will share that information with Canadians.
	But Anand told The Canadian Press in an interview this week that the original contracts to buy COVID-19 vaccines had to be vague about delivery dates because nobody knew at the time if the vaccines would be successful.
	It's only in the last few weeks, when the leading candidates from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca reported such positive results from their large clinical trials, that the way forward became clear enough for Anand's department to start asking the companies to be more specific about when they can make good on their contracts with Canada.
	""We put these contracts in place in order to place Canadians in the best stead possible, of any country in the world, recognizing that we would need to negotiate additional terms such as precise delivery dates, once a vaccine was discovered, and regulatory approval was obtained,"" she said. ""And that is what's happening now.""
	As Canadians face a pandemic-plagued holiday season and dream that 2021 will not be the anxiety-laden and often tragic disaster that 2020 has proven to be, there is one gleaming hope dangling still just out of reach: a vaccine for COVID-19.
	Still, the federal government has yet to answer one big question: When will it get here?
	It is not that she doesn't want to tell Canadians when, said Anand. But the complexities of figuring out a specific date are linked to when Health Canada approves the vaccine, and when the vaccine makers can see that Canada is ready to receive and safely distribute the precious doses, some of which have to be stored at temperatures below -70 C.
	Those pieces are starting to converge now.
	Health Canada officials are days, maybe even hours, away from approving the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech for use in Canada.
	Canadians got some more information on the logistics from a briefing of federal officials this week, including that Pfizer will ship its vaccine directly to 14 identified receiving sites in provinces. FedEx and Innomar Strategies were contracted Friday to oversee the delivery of other vaccines from a national receiving site to provinces.
	The National Advisory Committee on Immunization issued refined guidance Friday for who should get the vaccine first, including long-term care residents and workers, and people over the age of 80.
	The materials like syringes, gauze pads and bandages needed to vaccinate millions of people are in place. Ultralow temperature freezers have been purchased and nine new ones have already arrived. Provincial governments are lining up their own task forces.
	""We are going to have vaccines in this country, as expeditiously as possible,"" Anand said.
	Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole has been decrying the lack of clarity from the Liberals about the vaccine plan. A week ago he accused the Liberals of only starting to buy vaccines in a panic this summer after a collaboration with China on a vaccine fell apart.
	The partnership between the National Research Council and China's CanSino Biologics was announced in May to great fanfare. But the doses to be used in a Canadian clinical trial failed to arrive, when the Chinese government -- in the midst of political tensions with Canada -- refused to issue an export permit for them.
	""I would not have put all our eggs in the basket of China,"" O'Toole said Nov. 29, adding the timeline shows it wasn't until that deal fell apart that Canada ""started getting serious with Pfizer, Moderna, the other options.""
	Anand said that is not the case.
	She said the CanSino deal fell within Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains' portfolio, not her own, and nothing about the project prevented her from negotiating with other companies.
	Her marching orders to negotiate deals with other vaccine makers came weeks earlier. A team of procurement officials in her department was assigned to the file in March, at the same time as those negotiating contracts for medical supplies, personal protective equipment and rapid tests.
	In June, the COVID-19 vaccine task force provided a list of vaccines for Canada to pursue. Anand said talks with manufacturers began in early July. The first deal, with Massachusetts biotech firm Moderna, was struck July 24.
	Canada was first to sign with Moderna. It signed a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech a week later, on Aug. 1. It was the fourth country to do so, after the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan.
	News of trouble on the CanSino deal first appeared in early July when the doses still hadn't been approved for export by China. Canada walked away from the deal at the end of August when it became clear it would not happen.
	By then, Canada had deals with four other vaccine companies, including Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and NovaVax. It added deals with Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca in September and then with Canada's own Medicago the next month.
	Anand said Canada approached every contract with a similar goal -- to get 20 million doses guaranteed, and options to potentially buy more later on. In all, Canada is paying more than $1 billion to the seven vaccine makers for 194 million doses, even if those vaccines never get beyond the experimental stage.
	Another 220 million doses are available if Canada asks for them, a decision that will be made for the vaccines that are proving to be the best. Anand announced Friday another 20 million doses will come to Canada in 2021 from Moderna, for a total of 40 million.

              Bahrain now 2nd nation to grant Pfizer shot emergency use

	The island kingdom of Bahrain said Friday it has become the second nation in the world to grant an emergency-use authorization for the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.
	The state-run Bahrain News Agency made the announcement on Friday night, following an earlier announcement by the United Kingdom on Wednesday, making Britain the first in the world.
	""The confirmation of approval by the National Health Regulatory Authority of the kingdom of Bahrain followed thorough analysis and review undertaken by the authority of all available data,"" the kingdom said on its state-run Bahrain News Agency.
	Bahrain did not say how may vaccines it has purchased, nor when vaccinations would begin. It did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.
	Pfizer later told the AP that the details of its sales agreement with Bahrain, including the ""timing of delivery and the volume of doses,"" was confidential and declined to comment.
	""We have developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support effective vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring, Pfizer said. ""Our distribution is built on a flexible just in time system which will ship the frozen vials to the point of vaccination.""
	The immediate challenge for Bahrain would be the conditions in which the vaccine must be kept. They must be stored and shipped at ultra-cold temperatures of around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit). Bahrain is a Mideast nation that regularly sees temperatures in the summer of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity.
	Bahrain does have a state-owned carrier, Gulf Air, that it could use to transport the vaccines. In the nearby United Arab Emirates, the Dubai-based long-haul carrier Emirates has already said it is preparing its facilities to distribute vaccines at ultra-cold temperatures.
	The vaccine also requires two doses be given three weeks apart.
	Bahrain had already granted emergency-use authorization for a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and has inoculate some 6,000 people with it. That vaccine, an ""inactivated"" shot made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it, also is in use in the UAE.
	""The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to the kingdom's national COVID-19 response, which has strongly prioritized protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic,"" said Dr. Mariam al-Jalahma, the CEO of Bahrain's National Health Regulatory Authority.
	BioNTech, which owns the vaccine, said it has so far signed deals to supply 570 million doses worldwide in 2021, with options to deliver 600 million more. It hopes to supply at least 1.3 billion in 2021.
	Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is a small island off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf.
	With a population of 1.6 million, it has reported more than 87,000 cases and 341 deaths, according to the government. Over 85,000 people have recovered from the COVID-19 illness that is caused by the virus.
	The country is also home to a large expatriate population, with many low-paid labourers from southeast Asia living in tight housing. In July, authorities told the AP they had moved 8,000 labourers to new accommodations, disinfected housing and implemented a rule requiring no more than five labourers per room, with about 3 metres (10 feet) of space for each one.
	The Bahraini government says it has conducted over 2 million coronavirus tests across the island. It initially blamed its higher per-capita infection rate on that."
